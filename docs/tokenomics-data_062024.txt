What is Capitulation in Crypto Trading (And How to Respond To Sell-Offs):
(source: https://youtu.be/5GIDNpnEdRM?si=qqHFobFKi95fC7cw)
Importance of tokenomics
0:00
in this video i'm going to explain to
0:01
you how to properly evaluate
0:03
cryptocurrency tokenomics and if you're
0:06
completely unfamiliar tokenomics stands
0:09
for token economics and in this video
0:12
i'm going to explain to you three key
0:14
criteria that you need to analyze when
0:16
taking a look at an investment into a
0:18
certain cryptocurrency project those
0:20
three things that you need to look at is
0:22
number one understanding the supply of
0:24
the tokens number two is you need to
0:27
understand the monetary policy and the
0:29
number three is you need to understand
0:31
the token distribution in this video
0:33
we're going to cover all three of these
0:35
and i'm actually going to give you
0:36
examples so you'd see how i would
0:38
actually go ahead and look at a
0:40
cryptocurrency's tokenomics this is
0:42
extremely important that you understand
0:44
how to do this properly because you can
0:46
basically eliminate probably half of
0:49
cryptocurrency investments just on the
0:51
tokenomics alone this is going to help
0:53
you become a better investor a more
0:55
intelligent investor and ultimately help
0:57
you make more money once you understand
0:59
tokenomics thoroughly so with that being
1:02
said let's get into it my name is adam
1:04
winig i've been trading cryptocurrency
1:05
since 2014 and i created this channel to
1:09
help make crypto investing easy
1:10
lucrative and fun so if you're
1:12
interested then go ahead and click like
1:14
and subscribe and we've got a ton of
1:16
helpful videos on this channel so let's
1:19
go ahead and let's talk about it these
1:20
three keys number one is supply number
1:22
two is the monetary policy and number
1:24
three is the token distribution
1:27
starting off with supply so here's the
Token supply
1:30
main things that you want to understand
1:32
about a cryptocurrency's supply the
1:35
first thing is you'll notice that
1:36
there's two different types of supplies
1:39
there's the circulating supply which
1:41
this is the amount of coins or tokens
1:43
that are currently in circulation and in
1:46
the community the other metric is called
1:50
the max supply and the max supply is the
1:52
maximum amount of tokens or coins
1:55
that'll ever be in existence so for
1:57
bitcoin for example you can see that it
1:59
has a circulating supply of about 19
2:02
million and has a max supply of 21
2:05
million meaning there will never be more
2:07
than 21 million bitcoin now with that
2:09
being said on coin market cap you can
2:11
also see this gray bar right here and
2:14
you can see what percentage of the
2:16
circulating supply is all or what's
2:18
percentage of the max supply is already
2:21
in circulation you can see that there's
2:23
nearly 90 percent of the total max
2:26
supply already in circulation
2:29
now with that being said let's take a
2:31
look at a few different assets here's
2:33
another asset this is ethereum which
2:35
you're probably familiar with and you
2:37
can see with ethereum there's actually
2:39
no max supply which is interesting and
2:41
we'll talk about this when we talk about
2:43
monetary policy in just a second but
2:46
this is basically in an
2:48
inflationary cryptocurrency which we'll
2:51
talk more about in just a second now the
2:53
circulating supply of ethereum is
2:55
currently 119 million ethan circulation
2:59
now if we take a look at another
3:00
cryptocurrency like hedera hashgraph or
3:02
hbar you can see that it has a max
3:05
supply of 50 million coins and has a
3:08
circulating supply of only 18 billion
3:11
now this means that only 36
3:14
of the total max supply is in
3:16
circulation so one thing that you may
3:18
want to be aware of is if
3:21
there's a huge difference meaning that
3:23
there's going to be like what is this
3:25
there's going to be 32 billion more
3:28
of this cryptocurrency that comes onto
3:31
the market so obviously as more and more
3:33
of these coins flood the market this
3:35
could have a negative effect on price so
3:38
one thing that i like to look at is i
Marketcap vs. full diluted marketcap
3:40
like to look at the difference between
3:42
the market cap and the fully diluted
3:44
market cap and this can help us make
3:47
better investment decisions so to bring
3:49
it back to bitcoin for a second the
3:51
market cap is basically a general way to
3:54
tell how big this cryptocurrency is or
3:57
how much value this cryptocurrency has
4:00
and to calculate the market cap you
4:02
basically just multiply the current
4:05
price of it times the circulating supply
4:08
and that's going to give us the market
4:09
cap that's essentially how big it is and
4:12
you don't want to rate cryptocurrencies
4:13
based on the price you really want to
4:15
rank them based on the market cap the
4:17
price really doesn't have anything to do
4:19
with it it's more about the market cap
4:21
that gives you a a an idea of the size
4:25
and the adoption of a certain
4:27
cryptocurrency now the fully diluted
4:29
market cap this is essentially the max
4:32
supply
4:33
times
4:34
the
4:35
current price so the fully diluted
4:37
market cap is pretty much always going
4:39
to be larger than the market cap now one
4:42
thing when analyzing tokenomics is that
4:45
you want to find where there's not a
4:47
huge discrepancy between the market cap
4:49
and the fully diluted market cap if the
4:51
fully diluted market cap is way way way
4:54
way bigger than the market cap this
4:56
means that a lot of coins are still yet
4:58
to be issued and this means that you
5:01
know this could potentially have a
5:03
downward effect on the price of the
5:06
asset now if you look at ethereum for
5:08
example it's kind of hard to calculate
5:11
the fully diluted market cap because
5:12
there's no max supply on ethereum right
5:15
but if we go to hedera hashgraph for
5:17
example we can see it has a 50 billion
5:20
max supply so you can see there's quite
5:22
a difference the four billion dollar
5:24
market cap compared to the 12 billion
5:26
dollar fully diluted market cap so this
5:29
means that still a lot of these coins
5:31
tokens are going to be issued which uh
5:34
generally you know inflation is
5:35
generally not great for an asset now it
5:38
doesn't always have to be like that i'll
5:39
explain that in the next section so this
5:41
is all about the supply you need to
5:43
understand the circulating supply the
5:45
max supply the market cap and the fully
5:48
diluted market cap now the next thing
Monetary policy
5:50
that we want to talk about is the
5:52
monetary policy now unlike central banks
5:55
the monetary policy of cryptocurrencies
5:58
is actually set in code and that way
6:00
we're actually able to know what's going
6:02
to happen with the monetary policy with
6:04
central banks right we don't have any
6:06
idea they could come out one month they
6:08
have a meeting and say hey we're gonna
6:10
print two trillion dollars like we saw
6:12
last year happen in america which was
6:14
totally unplanned for and if you look at
6:16
examples like uh you know venezuela or
6:19
turkey or zimbabwe some of these
6:21
countries that have experienced
6:22
hyperinflation i'm sure the owners of
6:24
these currencies they didn't expect this
6:27
monetary policy to have so much
6:29
inflation or so much new supply come on
6:31
to the market and that's one of the
6:33
things that makes cryptocurrency
6:34
beautiful is the fact that it's
6:36
completely transparent so regarding
6:38
monetary policy there's really two main
6:41
types of policies it's either going to
6:43
be a deflationary asset or it's going to
Inflationary vs. deflationary
6:45
be an inflationary asset and let me
6:48
explain how this actually works a
6:50
deflationary monetary policy basically
6:53
means that you have a set max supply
6:56
like in bitcoin for this example we all
6:58
know that bitcoin has a max supply of 21
7:01
million bitcoin there will never be more
7:03
than 21 million bitcoin and this makes
7:06
it deflationary because every four years
7:09
as you know there's this halving which
7:11
basically means that uh you know
7:13
half of the amount of bitcoin can be
7:16
mined essentially that makes this a
7:18
deflationary model now on the other hand
7:21
we have an inflationary model which if
7:23
you're familiar with any fiat currency
7:26
it's an inflationary model right they
7:27
can continue to print more and more and
7:29
more of this currency now to put it into
7:32
perspective ethereum is an inflationary
7:34
token model and if you look at it any
7:37
currency and generally a lot of proof of
7:39
stake cryptocurrencies uh they don't
7:41
have a max supply so they're
7:43
inflationary in nature and they do this
7:46
so that way they can pay rewards out to
7:48
the stakers of the network and they can
7:50
they can reward people for staking or
7:53
setting aside um their cryptocurrency to
7:56
help uh validate the proof of stake
7:58
network so with that being said there is
8:01
a caveat to this because even though
8:03
ethereum is inflationary and new
8:05
ethereum continues to be pumped into the
8:08
market at the same time ethereum has
Token burning
8:10
actually been deflationary and you may
8:13
be thinking adam how the heck is it
8:15
deflationary if there continues to print
8:17
more and more ethereum or more and more
8:19
ethereum comes on the market and with
8:21
ethereum's newest upgrade they had in
8:23
what's called an
8:24
eip1559 upgrade basically they took a
8:28
percentage of all of the transaction or
8:32
gas fees that happened in ethereum and
8:34
they burned them and this is another
8:35
thing that you need to understand about
8:37
monetary policy is burning certain
8:40
cryptocurrencies like ethereum they'll
8:42
burn some of their supply or if you take
8:44
a look at
8:46
bnb binance coin uh essentially they
8:48
burn
8:49
a percentage of their supply every
8:51
single quarter and this can actually
8:53
have actually a really good effect on
8:56
the price of the asset because as you
8:58
know if it's a deflationary asset then
9:01
uh generally that's a good sign for
9:03
prices because the asset becomes more
9:05
scarce and that's why bitcoin has
9:07
performed so well over time is mostly
9:09
because of the scarcity and with
9:11
ethereum now even though new ethereum is
9:13
being issued into the market with the
9:16
eip1559 upgrade you can see that there's
9:19
already been like five billion dollars
9:21
of ethereum that has been burned in the
9:23
last month they burned nearly a billion
9:25
dollars 871 million dollars which is
9:28
actually a lot of the times making
9:29
ethereum a deflationary asset so that's
9:33
something else that you need to
9:34
understand when looking into tokenomics
9:36
is the burning now the last thing that
9:38
we really want to take a look at and
9:40
this is probably the thing that is maybe
9:42
going to move the needle the most is the
9:44
token distribution
Token distribution
9:46
and this essentially as you probably
9:48
could have guessed is how the tokens are
9:50
actually distributed amongst different
9:52
players in a cryptocurrency community
9:55
now there's two different types of
9:58
distributions one is called a fair
10:00
launch and a fair launch is when a
Fair launch vs. pre mine
10:03
crypto is mined earned owned and
10:06
regulated by the entire community if you
10:09
can see a fair launch generally this is
10:11
more favorable for investing okay an
10:14
example of a fair launch would be
10:16
something like bitcoin now if you don't
10:18
quite understand what a fair launch is
10:20
when i explain what a pre mine is you'll
10:22
pretty much get the idea of what a fair
10:24
launch is because it's pretty much exact
10:26
opposite now there's also something
10:28
called a pre mine you may also hear it
10:30
as like a pre-sale and essentially what
10:33
this is is a percentage of the tokens
10:36
prior to it actually being available to
10:38
the public will actually be
10:41
given or awarded to
10:43
certain members of the team or it may be
10:45
rewarded to developers or even to early
10:47
investors to essentially a private round
10:50
of fundraising and a lot of times this
10:53
can include vcs or venture capitalists
10:56
that can get access to these tokens
10:58
prior now this is a good and a bad thing
11:01
it's bad because these guys that get in
11:03
that basically pre-sales
11:05
they're going to get in and once the
11:07
token goes public a lot of the times
11:09
this is bad because they can dump on you
11:11
right because they're going to be up so
11:12
much and they can dump their tokens on
11:14
you which i'll explain a little bit more
11:16
in a second but it's also you have to
11:18
understand they are the ones taking the
11:20
risk before the project's even live a
11:22
lot of times when the project's just an
11:23
idea they take a massive amount of risk
11:26
and so they do get rewarded for doing so
11:29
so anyways long story short just to
11:31
break this down for you you can see that
11:34
from missouri.io
11:36
we can see how these are allocated and
11:38
generally as a general rule of thumb
11:41
the less that is uh given to insiders
11:44
the better okay if less is given to the
11:47
team and to vcs at pre-sale prices the
11:51
better because they don't have the
11:52
ability to dump on you right and in a
11:55
fair launch there's no tokens that are
11:57
given to pre you know to investors or to
12:00
the team or to um you know uh vcs prior
12:04
so
12:05
let's go ahead and take a look at this
12:06
so solana for example here you can see
12:09
that 48
12:11
of all the tokens were actually given to
12:13
insiders now this can be a red flag and
12:17
i'm not saying this doesn't make a
12:18
project good there's many other factors
12:20
that you need to
12:22
analyze when deciding to invest into
12:24
something but it is interesting that
12:26
nearly half of the supply is from
12:28
insiders so
12:30
this is just something to really to look
12:33
out for right if you take a look at
12:35
kadena for example you can see that only
12:37
23
12:38
was actually allocated to insiders if
12:41
you look at cello 44 avalanche 42
12:45
flow 58 percent
12:47
near 38
12:48
and the general rule of thumb is
12:51
the less that's allocated to insiders or
12:54
to the pre-sale or to the team or to vcs
12:57
um the better and again just think about
13:00
this vcs or the team they get in and
13:02
they get on an early prices say they get
13:05
at 10 cents and then for example when
13:07
the token first comes to the market to
13:09
the public it's worth you know a dollar
13:11
these guys are already up 10x so the
13:13
chances of them dumping on you is likely
13:16
okay and if they all sell at the same
13:18
time which happens time and time again
13:20
then this caused the price of the
13:21
cryptocurrency to fall dramatically now
13:23
i'd say the last thing that you really
13:25
want to understand is do you want to
13:27
understand what vesting means and a lot
Vesting
13:30
of these cryptocurrency projects they're
13:32
not so dumb to just allow these vcs or
13:35
these insiders or the people on the team
13:37
just to dump the token as soon as it's
13:39
publicly available or else that may be
13:41
really bad for future adoption if the
13:43
coin just dumps nobody's gonna want to
13:45
touch the thing right so there's
13:47
something called vesting investing
13:49
essentially what it means is how long is
13:52
it going to take for people to be able
13:55
to receive these tokens that they bought
13:58
at a pre-sale price and for example if
14:01
you look at uniswap here the unit token
14:04
they actually had a four year release
14:07
schedule which is really good the longer
14:09
the release schedule the better and i
14:11
like to see that there's like a minimum
14:12
of 12 months what does that mean if
14:15
there's a 12-month linear vesting
14:17
schedule that means over the course of
14:19
12 months those tokens are going to
14:21
slowly be leaked out to people okay now
14:24
also you may hear of something called
14:26
like a cliff and basically there could
14:29
be a situation where say vcs for example
14:32
uh they get to claim like 10
14:35
of their tokens right at the tge which
14:38
is the token generation event basically
14:40
when it becomes public so they can uh
14:42
get 10
14:43
and then they may have like a
14:45
three-month cliff which basically means
14:47
for three months they don't get any
14:48
other of their tokens that they were
14:50
able they're not able to sell any of
14:52
their tokens that they got at the
14:54
pre-sale prices and then there may be
14:56
another linear vesting schedule where
14:58
the remaining 90
15:00
are released to them over the course of
15:02
say a year or 18 months or two years for
15:05
example and again the less tokens that
15:08
are allocated to vcs or to insiders
15:11
generally the better and also the longer
15:14
the vesting schedule is also this is
15:16
better because it doesn't mean that
15:17
people are all going to dump all at one
15:19
time and maybe release slowly over time
15:21
and as these coins go into circulation
15:23
over time slow by slow it may not affect
15:26
price that much
15:28
so if we take a look at this for example
15:30
this is a crypto called aag it basically
15:33
has their vesting schedule right here
15:35
and generally you can see this in their
15:37
white paper
15:38
and you can see that the team has a
15:40
one-year lock up uh and then it has
15:44
daily vesting over three years so
15:46
basically for one year uh they're not
15:48
able to uh
15:50
claim any of their tokens and then over
15:52
three years they're slowly their tokens
15:54
are released which i would say is pretty
15:56
good now for the advisors there's an
15:58
eight month lock up and daily vesting
16:00
over three years i would say this is
16:02
also really good for private backers in
16:05
this scenario you can see that 10 was
16:08
allocated to private investors and it
16:10
looks like it's unlocked at the token
16:13
generation event which is basically when
16:15
it goes public there's a six month lock
16:17
up and then 90 of the allocation over
16:20
the course of 18 months okay
16:22
so these are the things that you want to
16:25
know and if this video was helpful
16:27
consider
16:28
giving it a like and subscribe to our
16:30

16:32
videos on our channel and i'll say that
16:34
if you really understand these three key
16:36
metrics uh the supply the monetary
16:39
policy and then the distribution of the
16:41
tokens you're going to be way way better
16:43
off probably better than 90 of crypto
16:45
investors out there also if you'd like
16:47

Real Estate Tokenization Masterclass:
(source: https://youtu.be/30SGdbU5stQ?si=li-b2QoHEPcZ63_j)
0:01
we are doing a panel discussion now about real estate organization but uh together with the organizers of
0:08
blueprint we agreed to do like a little intro first to tell me the intro so everyone can get on the same page
0:14
um so very briefly about ddcs we are a market leading provider of solutions for
0:21
to organization of real estate assets we provide a platform for driverization that you can use yourself to tokenize
0:28
your assets giving you the ability to manage invest onboarding
0:34
the fundraise checkup table and also facilitate trading among the investors that you that you onboard
0:42
it's an end-to-end wide level solution it's highly customizable integratable you can configure it with a variety of
0:50
configuration options to match exactly what you need we also work with a number of legal
0:55
Partners around the world to make sure that we and Google are compliance we we work with Securities everything if
1:03
you tokenize real estate you get real estate backed tokens it always becomes Securities so in relation to the SEC I
1:10
can say that it's fully supported by them and if we're doing a sec about the SEC once because they prefer everything
1:15
to be a security there's no issue with with the with them we are also soon launching the world's
1:22
first real estate or blockchain-based real estate Exchange in Q4 here in the US
1:30
the organization itself is of course something that happens on the chain on the blockchain
1:35
but blockchain can be viewed as a kind of Global Network or Global Excelsior
1:41
Global database where there is a high degree or total consensus about the contents so if you consider the
1:47
blockchain as a global Excel sheet you can view the rows as the wallets con the
1:53
wall is owned by individuals and to companies and the columns can be viewed as the contents of these walls Bitcoin
2:00
ethereum digital security students and currencies and so on and this sort of global
2:06
chain maintains massive incentives to keep the
2:11
information correct within it massive decent sensitives to introduce 40 information and so on so it is a Global
2:18
Network that allows us to facilitate transactions with Securities digital currencies and so on and it's available
2:25
for software companies I guess to build applications of Sabbath to introduce a lot of new innovation
2:32
so basically tokenization is the process of representing ownership rights with tokens on the chain
2:39
so you can tokenize an LLC that owes a property and you base it basically tokenize the shares of that company and
2:45
you'd get tokenized Securities the tokenized says this is a typical way to do it I think 95 of our clients have
2:53
done it this way it's and a way that is easily recognized by regulators and by legal firms it's
3:00
also a way that gives a high degree of investor protection for investors
3:06
um the tokenization space has been predicted to grow extremely fast the next few years to a total value of 4
3:12
trillion US Dollars by 2030 by City Bank and by all the leading companies in the space
3:20
organization has a lot of benefits that are briefly described here of course with tokenization you can
3:25
digitize the modernize and automate Work Source related to investor onboarding
3:31
subscription and trading and get massively reduced administrative cost
3:36
this automation this higher PF automation allows you to fractionalize
3:41
and to handle thousands of investors as easily as you can handle 10 or 20 investors today
3:47
this in turn allows you to reduce the ticket size from a hundred thousand down to maybe 100 or 1 South with 10 000 US
3:54
Dollars and we get more accessible for retail and smaller investors
4:00
you can also enable trading very easily with this type of Technology because you can control the transactions via
4:07
Software System outside the existing existing Financial ecosystem so you can facilitate peer-to-peer
4:14
trading directly from wallet to wallet in a way that has no counter body risk using a smart contract this can be done
4:21
both internally via a platform like our system or also externally on Exchange
4:28
so basically you can get full control using your own platform you can automate you can reduce cost you
4:34
can make your assets liquid tradable just by making an asset tradable you can
4:40
actually increase the value of the asset Itself by 20 to 30 percent this is called the eliquidity premium and it has
4:46
to do with the inability of investors to exit the investment before the maturation of the of the investment
4:52
itself which normally results in a loss um you can open up retail investors due
4:59
to crease ticket size and you can make the assets more attractive to institutional investors because they
5:04
become more liquid finally in the future within a few years
5:09
we will also be able to open up to highly competitive highly efficient lending opportunities in the default
5:16
lending ecosystem where it's possible to sort of submit your real estate backed tokens that get access to D5 Lending
5:23
this would become highly attractive and I think a huge opportunity and Innovation itself when it becomes
5:28
available over the next year too first we have to make assets liquid then it becomes possible to use them as
5:34
collateral for for Lending that's it for me and it's my pleasure now to keep over the microphone to keep
5:42
us so he can start hosting the panel and you can find us at our stand next to a
5:47
track two if you want to hear more about the tokenization so uh thank you
5:53
hi everyone my name is Gabriel I work with Klaus at Digi shares and I'll be uh the moderator for today
6:01
um so I'll let the three other panelists introduce themselves uh we'll start with
6:06
Laura and move them to the end thank you my name is Laura palmettia and I've been in real estate and development for 20
6:12
years working on pre-construction on that side of the industry and I pivoted
6:17
into the blockchain space about three years ago helping owners developers to implement Ai and blockchain into their
6:24
real estate projects Scott Purcell founder and CEO of Fortress blockchain Technologies not a
6:31
real estate guy but I know a few things about technology and blockchain my company provides Financial Regulatory
6:38
and Technology infrastructure for blockchain innovators Michael flight been in real estate since
6:44
1986 primarily institutional real estate uh made a pivot in
6:51
2018 or 19 we started looking to raise funds outside the U.S on blockchain and
6:59
so we created a product called Liberty real estate fund
7:04
thank you so um let's start with the technology and its benefits
7:09
um we'll start with you Scott why should a real estate developer real estate fund
7:15
uh tokenize their assets a very large question I
7:21
the blockchain is a ledger right now where everybody uses other two column ledgering systems that were popularized
7:28
by the medicis in the 1400s the blockchain is an update on that and so anything that is digital winds up
7:35
eventually going on the blockchain or being accessible via token tokenized
7:41
authentication from the blockchain that includes Healthcare records California is already starting to tokenize uh DMV
7:48
records and car titles so it certainly includes real estate
7:53
tokenizing an asset makes it much easier to maintain makes it easier to control
7:59
makes it easier to transact to buy and sell to settle transactions for Real
8:06
Estate imagine a world with no title companies imagine a world with no uh
8:12
very light legal on uh on a transaction from the changing ownership uh imagine a
8:20
situation where renters can more easily make payments and where liens and things
8:28
can be clearly seen and clearly cleared quickly without bureaucracy or
8:33
regulatory overhang so the blockchain is a new ledgering system as real estate
8:38
title and other Records begin to be tokenized really clears up the industry and creates a whole new swath of
8:45
innovation and acceleration anybody have anything to add to the
8:51
benefits sometimes a use case that they're excited about or
8:56
and I think uh blockchain really is going to help investors I'm primarily
9:02
interested in Securities and raising capital and uh it really creates a lot
9:08
of uh investor optionality for investors so for example if they did a typical
9:14
syndication with me it's a paper syndication uh they'd be stuck with me for five my mother was actually in a
9:22
deal she couldn't get out of for close to 40 years uh so with the investor
9:27
optionality it allows investors to not only trade their Securities but also you
9:35
can potentially pledge them as collateral and there's a whole host of things it's also going to help sponsors
9:42
like me maintain your cap tables and a number of other different things so that
9:48
you can have a better relationship with your investors you know I just want to add that there's
9:54
this really important social cause around tokenization also right Community involvement allowing
10:01
tenants potentially right your your community to participate in your real
10:06
estate offering so there's returns potentially to your to your tenants that
10:11
live in the building and then therefore they're going to keep you know better care of the building Etc so there's
10:17
there's that aspect to tokenization as well sounds great thank you
10:24
um so it sounds like um you know increasing the efficiency of transactions increasing liquidity and
10:30
making the investor appearance experience much better and um increasing participation democratization are all um
10:38
um fantastic benefits so Laura if I'm a
10:44
head of a real estate company and I want to tokenize my my assets today what do I
10:51
do yeah you know I would start with assembling a really great team for any
10:57
project that's probably the most important aspect is having those that understand your real estate offering
11:04
um potentially a project manager someone like myself that can walk that project through Usher it through every stage of
11:10
tokenization from um from the offering you know to the
11:17
option of secondary liquidity I think also having a really great legal team that has done this before right you
11:23
don't want your legal team learning on your dime right about tokenization and how how to create that type of offering
11:31
I also feel that obviously having a great technology provider the technology
11:37
is really important not just for digitizing the assets or migrating traditional Securities onto blockchain
11:45
but that a provider that understands real estate right that understands the
11:51
complexities of the cap table real estate cap table how to manage that once
11:56
once those Securities are on chain and you know potentially you could have a broker dealer involved or a transfer
12:03
agent potentially a marketing company there's a lot of aspects of the offering that are very traditional
12:10
uh from there creating the offering making sure that your
12:15
business model is ideal for for tokenization right that it is the option
12:22
of liquidity is important to the investors yeah um online Capital formation how are
12:27
we going to fund that you know what what strategies are we are we selling tokens
12:33
are we selling investment shares you know what does that look like is it real estate and then also
12:40
um the digitization bringing bringing all that information onto blockchain
12:46
like I just said with your technology company and then having a proper strategy for your secondary Market
12:52
liquidity having the option and knowing that in advance who the right partner is
12:57
uh for giving your investors that optional liquidity right on an
13:03
alternative trading system um that I think that is that kind of
13:08
covers the majority of it uh thank you and Klaus uh did you share as you've
13:14
seen many uh projects um you know maybe what are some of the
13:20
best practices or advice that you would have to someone that wants to tokenize their assets
13:26
there's a good question I would say we we are we cover globally right we have clients in more than 40 countries so we
13:33
are aware of regulations in many countries and actually we we really like the U.S
13:39
regulation and within organization so too many of our clients we recommend that they work out of the U.S as jurisdiction
13:45
so of course it's important to have a good legal partner and to make sure that you are compliant but in
13:51
the U.S we have at least seven or eight legal partners that can facilitate such a service then it's good also to have a good
14:00
advisor consultancy partners that can help structure the project for you and I
14:06
would say in our system you can choose among a number of configurations so we have for instance a partner simple forces here on
14:13
stage that allows you to have very safe cost debuffs of crypto and and Fiat
14:19
currencies right so there's a number of recommendations that we typically go through with the new clients that we set up
14:26
thank you and and Michael obviously you were one of the first uh to tokenize real estate assets uh that's why some of
14:33
you some of us call you the Godfather of real estate tokenization um what's your advice and what have you
14:39
learned in your that was the Forbes crypto editor and he said we need a name for you he goes I'm going to call you
14:45
the Godfather like you're just calling me that because I'm old so but anyway one of the uh the the larger issues and
14:53
just with anything but especially with tokenization uh and I know Klaus doesn't
14:59
want to hear this but uh the tokenization part of it is probably the easiest the structuring part of it is is
15:05
probably the harder part so it's not only um you know structuring it legally
15:11
within your jurisdiction especially the United States um and I I have a lot of people still
15:16
come to me and say oh um you know now that the SEC is going after crypto your
15:21
you know business model is really going to have some problems I'm like no we're following the same you you know SEC
15:26
regulations that have been around since 1933 but one of the other issues that a
15:32
lot of people don't you know really think about is you need to make sure that your financing partner if you're
15:38
putting financing on a deal your financing partner has to be okay with a
15:44
change of ownership if the tokens start trading so there's a whole host of other
15:50
things that you really need not only Securities attorneys but you also need structuring deal structuring attorneys
15:56
and most importantly uh you you need especially if you're going to do non-us
16:01
investors investing into the U.S you need accountants that will help you
16:07
structure those structures but after that um we're still like really excited we're
16:13
in the first inning of this and at some point I I've got relationships with probably more than 500 Capital razors
16:19
and all of them are looking at this because number one it's going to help them you know issue Securities more
16:26
efficiently but also have better relationships and give their investors
16:31
extra options thank you and um Scott you have a lot of
16:36
experience with the whole compliance aspect uh obviously Fortress is a Trust Company a regulated entity
16:44
um what would you say about the the the U.S regulatory environment I mean so
16:49
digicares has a booth here and uh we've had a lot of um people come to us and
16:55
um one of the things that people say is oh
17:00
um is this compliant you know the headlines are bad about the blockchain industry or should I be doing this what
17:06
would you answer to someone with those concerns hi
17:12
there's a lot of confusion about it and a lot of lawyers are confused a lot of regulators are confused lawmakers but
17:20
the reality is that delivering ownership of something in a tokenized manner
17:26
whether it's fungible or non-fungible token or start getting into that but is if I invest in a sec in a real estate
17:35
deal and he gives me a piece of paper that represents my fractional ownership
17:42
in that deal the paper is not his security what's a security is my investment in
17:48
that in that deal the paper just represents that if he sends me an email instead of a piece of paper with a PDF
17:54
attached that represents my interest the PDF is not a security if he tokenizes it and
18:01
sends me an nft or a punchable token that nft or fungible token is not a
18:06
security the security is what I invested in and probably the SPV the LLC that he
18:12
set up if I own a piece of Real Estate and like my my wife owns a bunch of
18:19
apartments and she rents out and I decide to put the title in trust not into an LLC but in trust in this case
18:26
and the ownership the beneficiary has represents his interest in that
18:31
trust within nft that is not a security so you really have to look at what it is
18:38
you're doing in the use case if you're investing in something it's a security it doesn't matter if you're holding an
18:44
nft that represents or reflects your ownership in that and if you own an
18:49
apartment or a house that's in an nft that their title is held in trust that way you don't have to go to the type to
18:55
go to the city or state every time you sell it you just transfer the nft to somebody super easy that's not a
19:01
security so the regulatory issues here are actually pretty simple
19:07
people are just over complicating them yeah so Laura you would like that
19:13
um just to add and I just got makes a really great point in that these are
19:18
digitally wrapped right the the idea that it's very different from cryptocurrency
19:25
and that you have crypto where if you aren't in control of those assets right
19:32
they could disappear to someone else if they're stolen or lost but if for some reason your security tokens right that
19:39
are backed by your real estate are misplaced or transferred uh in as an
19:45
accident or stolen for some reason they're just they're just burned and reissued so there's a very secure aspect
19:54
um that that is in place here where we're talking about real estate backed Securities and and digitizing them onto
20:00
blockchain yeah that's exactly right yeah and I just wanna the other what are the other issues is the secondary market
20:06
so right now secondary markets are really thin and one of the great things is is that uh Digi shares created real
20:13
estate.exchange to you know so you're looking at one of the guys that is primarily built out this entire industry
20:21
and that's Klaus here and in in this guy the payment system I mean so these are
20:26
like really two early blockchain movers and um you know basically created this
20:32
industry but uh Klaus not only created the tokenization part of it but now they're you know moving into
20:38
crowdfunding they're also moving into uh the real estate exchange for secondary
20:43
Marketplace so maybe you could talk about that a little bit yeah I think it's uh one of the key benefits of
20:49
tokenizing um an asset is is providing liquidity optionality to to investors so Klaus so
20:56
could you tell us a bit about you know why uh you decided to launch real estate.exchange
21:02
Yeah we actually prefer to have we like the white label business model where we
21:08
don't sort of directly to organize anything ourselves but rather provide
21:13
infrastructure to us we because it's a very very scalable and
21:19
it's uh sort of not so legally complicated so but so we were actually waiting for several years for someone to
21:25
launch an exchange for Real Estate but uh at the end decided to do it on our own to just make sure that the industry
21:31
gets started because there is a leg of liquidity in the in the space and we didn't really see anyone coming forward
21:38
with an exchange particularly for Real Estate assets that could be uh useful
21:43
for all the the many companies that are tokenizing assets so every time we speak to uh yeah I would say 90 of all the
21:51
clients we speak to are interested in getting the assets traded at at some point so it's I think it's the number
21:58
one use case in the industry that we can turn real estate into into a liquid asset and it's uh exciting for us that
22:05
we are now finally after much development much legal work and able to launch The Exchange in Q4 most likely in
22:13
in the US so it's we are working under the eight the license of a company
22:19
called Texas capital broker dealer at ATS so we are able to compliantly trade Securities in in a tokenized form
22:27
thank you absolutely um so maybe we can start going to some
22:32
of the questions here um so has any of you ever worked with a
22:38
real estate tokenization in Canada rules and regulations being different
22:44
um I know that yeah DJ shares has a couple of uh um Canadian clients so um I yeah it's
22:52
it's definitely possible to tokenize assets over there I don't know if anybody has uh anything to add on that
22:58
um most of the Canadian Securities laws are very similar to the U.S Securities
23:04
loss so yeah so it should definitely be be possible
23:09
um so um let's see uh challenges of interoperability and that's that's maybe
23:14
something interesting to talk about so um uh ethereum at least at Digi shares
23:20
we see a lot of activity and projects happening in the ethereum ecosystem
23:27
um it's very well positioned as the first mover to be The Ledger that people
23:32
use for smart contracts and and tokens um uh what are your what's your opinion
23:38
on ethereum and and maybe some other competing uh chains Nono wants to start
23:44
with that blockchains are like religions everyone's got their favorite and
23:50
everyone thought you talked to their their chain is the is the best chain uh
23:55
and you're generally not going to win that argument uh the reality is that ethereum has by far the vast majority of
24:03
developers working on it and development and that includes what are called L2 Layer Two Chains which are uh like
24:10
polygon with Matic uh so if you're looking to do something new you should
24:16
just stick with the thing where all the developers are and all the people are if you want to go to Solana cardano
24:23
any of the hundreds of other chains uh great if you have the developers go for
24:29
it the key thing is can your users whoever the end person whether
24:35
it's an investor or it's a renter or it's an owner whoever that person is are they going to
24:40
be able to get it are they going to be able to receive that tokenized asset or that token as security from you and if
24:47
it's on hbar well idea how are they going to get at it what wallet takes that well it
24:54
supports it if it's on ethereum every wallet supports it every dashboard supports it so it also depends on which
25:02
standard you're minting under because you want to be able to if somebody steals it get it back right or same with
25:07
Securities and securities get it maintain the ledger so there's you know
25:13
a lot of issues to consider but generally just stay with the my advice
25:19
just stay with the primary one or the L2 like uh polygon because that way the
25:24
fees are less when people transfer whereas ethereum the gas fees the transaction fees tend to be pretty high
25:31
thank you so we'll go to Michael and then Klaus yeah the way I explain it to people um and some of you that weren't around
25:38
in the 1980s might not understand this but it's the difference between BHS and betamax betamax was the you know much
25:45
better technology solution so there could be some better technology solution out there but the large majority of
25:52
developers developing are developing on evm compatible chains in ERC uh
25:58
compatible tokens I also got a comment on that yeah I think that Scott and Michael said most
26:04
of what I wanted to say I think the the question goes into the the issue of interoperability and I
26:11
would say working with different chains and so on and it is it is a it is a real
26:16
challenge but uh but uh I think it's it's we are getting we are seeing maybe 95 of all projects
26:24
tokenizing on ethereum so in fact in relation to the chain itself it's it is mostly interoperable what we see we at
26:31
TN agnostic and support six to seven different change so we can tokenize the different chains but it's correct what Scott is saying why do you want to have
26:38
sufficient support for different wallets you want to have sufficiently created before the stable coins on the chain
26:44
they want to have uh custodians working on the chain and so on and really ethereum has the best support for any of
26:50
those choices so even though it's a little bit more expensive and and for real estate transactions that doesn't matter so much uh ethereum
26:58
is is normally the best choice I would say then we are still we're using different protocols across ethereum
27:05
which is a quest an issue also for interoperability but it sort of started to converge a bit and there's also still
27:12
no standard for decentralized ID but I think that's also going to standardize over the next few years and anyone took
27:18
an IC on ethereum now can easily sort of upgrade their tokens later on when when standards changed maybe at some point
27:26
so it's it's I don't see it as a big issue thanks so a question for you Laura maybe
27:31
from the the Q a feed um so how does the physical deed transfer can you talk about you know the
27:38
the D the title and and the the link with um tokenizing
27:43
um the Securities uh so that's a really great question and there's there's a lot of
27:49
um you know there's a lot of different when when I say tokenization to someone like
27:55
Gabriel he he envisions a certain way to apply tokenization to the space when I
28:02
say tokenization to someone who is transferring real estate product from
28:08
one person to another in its entirety they see tokenization as a completely different
28:13
um you know something completely different which it is and it's both so being able to tokenize real estate and
28:20
transfer Real Estate product from one person to another we can do that through tokenization the the way that
28:29
um we do real estate transactions today is a very lengthy
28:34
Antiquated process there's a lot of repetitive processes in in the
28:40
transaction a lot of that can be streamlined if it is written on blockchain and and
28:45
being able to track that title as it transfers from one person to another we
28:51
can eliminate a lot of a lot of fraud right you can eliminate title insurance
28:58
I wasn't going to say it but yeah absolutely yeah but one of the realities is that's
29:05
why I primarily work with Securities because right now when they talk about transferring title they're basically
29:12
transferring the ownership of an LLC or an spb um and I am more skeptical about whether
29:20
title is going to it it's eventually going to go on blockchain uh but you
29:25
have to deal with every count for in the United States you have to deal with every County and so that's a lot of
29:31
political patronage jobs you have to deal with title insurance companies who pay a lot of lobbying fees and then you
29:38
have to pay you know if you deal with like real estate brokers who are also some of the largest lobbies you know in
29:45
each individual state so I'm skeptical as to it'll probably be the last thing
29:50
to go online but you know I could be proven wrong but there's a lot of political uh pressure pushing against
29:57
um you know something where you know things transfer immediately and then you get into the whole Bearer asset
30:05
um you know whether your actual possession is actually possession of title like versus a cryptocurrency where
30:12
your actual possession of Bitcoin is possession of Bitcoin all right so we're running out of time
30:18
maybe just uh one last question with a quick answer there are some questions on the feed about nfts uh how do you see
30:25
nfts fitting into the to real estate tokenization uh ecosystem
30:31
um maybe yep Scott one one thing about when nft stopping security yet it's funny a lot of people like nfts their
30:38
Securities and from a real estate perspective uh I had a video of Josh Altman from Million Dollar Listings
30:43
saying happy birthday to my wife and so I minted an nft so it's in my wallet and her wallet and nft of Josh Altman saying
30:51
happy birthday to my wife not a security uh not any way shape or form so the you
30:59
know the question is it makes transactions easier as you were pointing out it makes Capital raising more
31:05
efficient how you track it based on the different ethereum standards that are
31:10
within the technology that you provide a lot of this infrastructure is here now starting to we're starting to mature the
31:17
trading systems uh everything about it but also then the ownership of it so
31:23
it's uh you know it's really an amazing Frontier that we're entering thank you so we have 15 seconds left
31:30
there's a question about the standards is it erc20 I'm going to answer that in five seconds
31:35
um generally a enhancement of erc20 is used such as ERC 1404 for example all
31:42
right that's it uh thanks thank you to the panelists and thank you for joining thank you [Music]


THE TOKENIZATION OF EVERYTHING:
(source: https://youtu.be/RevcQYj8DxE?si=eoVpT9uKJLETTLzP)

Intro
0:01
[Music]
0:06
[Applause]
0:08
I want to talk a little bit about what I
Overview
0:11
sort of talked refer to as the
0:13
tokenization of everything and but I'm
0:16
going to sort of set the stage a little
0:17
bit by talking about from circles
0:20
perspective sort of how we think about
0:22
you know first what is the fundamental
0:24
innovation that enables the tokenization
0:27
of everything and how to kind of
0:28
classify different layers of value in
0:31
the crypto ecosystem and then I want to
0:35
talk specifically about what this
0:38
opportunity means for financial assets
0:40
and that's really the focus of circle
0:42
we're a financial company but building
0:44
on top of crypto infrastructure just
0:47
first a little bit about circle if you
0:49
aren't familiar we have a number of
0:51
different product initiatives I'm not
About Circle
0:53
going to talk about these in much detail
0:55
here we have a free payment service
0:58
circle pay that's behind the scenes
1:02
built on crypto and blockchain tech we
1:05
have a retail focused app that is is
1:08
just coming out called circle invest
1:09
lets you very easily invest in a wide
1:13
variety or an initial variety of crypto
1:15
assets and expanding that quite a bit
1:18
and we just acquired a crypto exchange
1:22
which we we think of as ultimately a
1:25
token marketplace and I'll come back to
1:27
that as we talk about the tokenization
1:29
of everything we sort of internally call
1:31
that circle X and then circle trade
1:34
which is not a retail thing but
1:36
basically we are one of the largest
1:38
traders of crypto assets in the world we
1:40
trade for billion a month in crypto with
1:43
a wide range of institution so
1:45
institutions that are doing a lot with
1:48
crypto investing and trading would work
1:50
with that service and then we have a new
1:52
nonprofit foundation which is spinning
1:56
out of circle called Center and that's
1:58
an open source project and a payment
2:01
scheme for using what we refer to as
2:05
fiat backed stable coins over public
2:09
blockchain so basically replacing things
2:11
like the visa network but using real
2:13
fiat money and stable coin architectures
2:16
and that's something that is in
2:19
development and
2:20
we'll release more of later this year
2:23
just sort of coming way up a level from
2:26
some of the the deeper dives technically
2:28
that we've had today and yesterday just
2:31
at a high level how we at least think
2:33
about kind of the crypto basics you know
2:37
first what is this revolution that we're
2:39
dealing with at the highest level we
2:41
think of it as a few things the the
2:44
first is an open immutable incorruptible
2:49
record-keeping system that's a layer
2:51
that we're seeing built which is super
2:53
valuable
2:54
the second is ideally also an open
2:58
immutable transaction processing system
3:01
so you can process transactions about
3:03
those records in a very open way in a
3:05
very incorruptible and immutable way and
3:07
then lastly and related is ideally also
3:12
an open immutable secure computation
3:14
system so you can write code in an open
3:17
way in a transparent way that can be
3:19
deployed and and in unmodifiable fashion
3:22
in a very auditable fashion so secure
3:24
computation secure transaction
3:26
processing and and then this immutable
3:28
record-keeping system and those to us at
3:31
least those are the the kind of
3:32
fundamental breakthroughs there are many
3:34
others but these are the fundamental
3:35
breakthroughs that we get really excited
3:37
about and from our perspective this is
3:40
just like a new fundamental
3:41
infrastructure layer of the internet
3:43
it's a new layer that's been missing
3:44
from the internet for the last 20 years
3:47
and it's now being sort of laid down
3:49
right as we speak so in addition of the
Economic Incentives
3:54
sort of technical innovation what makes
3:56
these really interesting and makes all
3:57
this really interesting is that this is
4:00
sort of a combination of both technology
4:03
and sort of economic incentives so
4:05
economic incentives plus protocols plus
4:08
Network schemes that essentially allow
4:10
us to operate these global public
4:12
utilities and global platforms without
4:16
any central corporation without any
4:18
government running them and and as this
4:21
crosses into the realm of value and
4:23
value exchange and and sort of
4:26
fundamental record-keeping of society
4:28
that's pretty powerful we haven't had
4:30
global public utilities that everyone
4:33
build on and rely on for these types of
4:35
tasks and so that's what makes I think
4:37
this very exciting when we sort of drill
4:41
more deeply into it what I'm excited
4:43
about is that this allows us to for the
4:46
first time really ever at least in the
4:49
modern age really rethink what our micro
4:53
economic units are so we really rethink
4:56
what is a corporation what defines it
4:59
what is the nature of that entity how
5:01
does that exist in the world how does
5:03
that interact with value with labour and
5:06
the output of that value and really reek
5:08
inception eyes that in this very global
5:11
digital environment so that's what we're
5:15
excited about in in a more mundane way
5:19
we think about the industries that this
5:22
impacts and a lot of you know a lot of
5:25
folks focus it on payments or they focus
5:28
in on narrower use cases secure private
5:32
value exchange and and so forth we're
5:35
interested in how this applies across a
5:37
lot of different industries and at a
5:40
high level I think about fiduciary and
5:42
record-keeping industries as including a
Industries
5:45
lot of different things so that includes
5:46
essentially every dimension of finance
5:48
and financial is not just like bank
5:52
accounts and payments it's a really
5:54
really deep and broad domain of
5:57
businesses and and use cases the entire
6:01
accounting profession how we count
6:03
things keep track of things audit things
6:05
verify things make sure people are
6:07
trustworthy trustworthy make sure
6:09
businesses are trustworthy so the entire
6:11
practice of accounting can be reinvented
6:13
on this the insurance industry which is
6:16
like really not like the most exciting
6:18
industry in the world but but
6:20
essentially it's this vast multi
6:22
trillion dollar industry of people
6:23
placing bets on outcomes in society we
6:27
have an opportunity to reinvent how that
6:30
industry works the very basics of
6:32
corporate and commercial law how we
6:35
actually apply rules to and adjudicate
6:38
value exchange and records and and the
6:42
like basically every system of voting
6:45
and governance
6:47
that's that includes governments
6:49
obviously and voting in governments but
6:52
also I think more more directly
6:54
governance of corporations right now
6:57
voting and equity are really tied
7:00
together and then when we think about
7:02
how decisions are ultimately made inside
7:05
of businesses the the very fundamental
7:07
value based decisions are made with
7:08
governance which are basically just a
7:11
bunch of people sitting around and law
7:13
firms intermediating and there's again
7:16
an opportunity to pretty dramatically
7:18
improve that and then ultimately kind of
7:21
every kind of record-keeping
7:25
certification oriented public and civil
7:28
service everything from the DMV to your
7:31
house title to land ownership to all the
Crypto Assets
7:35
different types of record-keeping that
7:36
exists that run society also can can be
7:40
reinvented so when you kind of add these
7:42
up it ends up looking like a really
7:44
really broad layer and these are all
7:47
industries which you know basically
7:49
haven't been changed that much by the
7:51
internet to date you can argue at the
7:53
surface that they have through access
7:55
through web browsers and apps and so on
7:57
but at the core those industries really
8:00
haven't changed that much and so I think
8:01
what's at stake here is the ability to
8:03
revisit and rebuild all these in a
8:05
completely new way before getting into
8:09
sort of how we think about tokenization
8:11
of everything I want to break down how
8:14
at least we think about the sort of
8:15
different categories of crypto assets
8:18
and we think of crypto assets as as you
8:23
know purely digital assets that are
8:24
issued and mediated either issued as or
8:29
by public blockchains
8:32
they have free-floating value market
8:35
price free-floating value and are liquid
8:36
typically on a growing number of digital
8:39
asset exchanges so there there can be
8:41
crypt or assets perhaps that live
8:42
outside of this definition but this is
8:44
the definition that I'm looking at which
8:46
are these sort of public lis available
8:49
crypto assets and we kind of break that
8:51
into a few categories crypto currencies
8:53
crypto commodities and crypto securities
8:56
and we have to look at these through
8:59
these lenses because of legal
9:00
regulatory issues because actual
9:01
governments are actually classifying
9:03
these and saying if you want to handle
9:05
these this type or that type or another
9:07
type you actually have different laws
9:09
that apply to you as a business
9:12
despite at the end of the day all this
9:13
just basically being open-source
9:15
software that people are applying so
Crypto Currencies
9:19
cryptocurrencies obviously include
9:20
things like Bitcoin as well as a lot of
9:22
other currencies so we have a lot of
9:26
privacy focused and I would include even
9:28
Bitcoin in that from its original design
9:30
goal as an anonymous digital cash what I
9:34
would refer to as settlement tokens so
9:37
cryptocurrencies that were at least
9:39
initially conceptualized as tokens that
9:42
are part of settlement schemes for fiat
9:44
currency transactions like ripple and
9:46
stellar although these are evolving in
9:48
their design center and then a sort of
9:51
stable coins is also in our mind of
9:54
cryptocurrency so stable coins being
9:56
various types of coins that are meant to
9:59
act as stable stable mediums of exchange
10:03
and so there are a lot of different
10:05
approaches to stable coins I'm going to
10:07
touch on that in a few minutes as well
10:09
we think it's pretty fundamental but
10:11
ultimately fiat backed stable coins will
10:14
be a really popular form of
10:16
cryptocurrency in the world and we're
10:18
right on the cusp of I think seeing that
10:20
on a larger scale crypto commodities we
10:24
think of as a a crypto asset that is
10:27
used as a token of some sort to consume
10:30
or utilize some other infrastructure
10:32
resource or application so aetherium is
Crypto Commodities
10:35
probably the best known example of that
10:37
ether is a is a an asset that is a
10:41
commodity asset that is used to consume
10:44
computation resources that it provides
10:46
on its network there are other projects
10:49
that are similar or have different
10:51
certainly design goals in some cases but
10:53
fundamentally our commodities that are
10:56
meant to be used to consume a
10:58
infrastructure service oftentimes or
11:01
higher-level applications as well you
11:04
know these are really ambitious projects
11:07
I think they represent
11:09
a kind of new OS layer for the internet
11:12
a new OS layer for the global economy so
11:14
i'm i think these crypto commodities and
11:17
the associated computing platforms are
11:18
are pretty fundamental and and obviously
11:23
relate to this last category of crypto
11:25
securities so you know crypto securities
11:28
are and these are just my definitions
11:31
new forms of tokenized securities and
11:34
what i mean by that is they're rules
11:36
based financial contracts that that are
11:40
using these underlying crypto computing
11:42
systems as the record keeping engines as
11:45
the transaction of settlement layers for
11:48
the securities for these contracts
11:49
themselves but they have a lot of new
11:51
capabilities that go way way beyond what
11:55
we traditionally think of as a security
11:57
like an equity or a bond which are the
12:00
classic types of securities that we
12:03
think of in the financial world
12:04
they go well beyond in terms of what
12:06
they can offer how they can be used and
12:08
the power that they can put in the hands
12:10
of ultimately the users that would use
12:12
these types of securities but but today
12:14
you know when we think of securities we
12:16
think of law firms and we think of you
12:18
know paper based stuff like my stock
12:21
certificate and and what rights i might
12:24
have as a shareholder in a business we
12:26
don't really think about something as
12:28
powerful as crypto securities these
12:31
obviously often and almost always merge
12:34
some form of utility value with
12:35
financial value so all this sort of
12:39
builds to this idea of the tokenization
12:41
of everything and you know in our mind
12:44
we're at the beginning stages of this
12:49
sort of process and we're essentially
12:51
every asset every form of financial
12:55
value but every asset can be stored and
12:58
as a crypto token and can have
13:02
associated rules and contracts
13:03
associated with it so that in in our
13:05
mind means that essentially every fiat
13:07
currency your dollars your RM B's your
13:11
your peso etc all forms of equities
13:15
every form of stock that we know of
13:16
in the world today every form of debt
13:20
relationship a bonded debt relationship
13:23
reform of loan every insurance contract
13:26
all of these things we think will be
13:28
tokenized will become crypto assets that
13:33
are stored and computed and verified and
13:37
exchanged on these infrastructures and
13:40
ultimately the securitization of every
13:42
form of property so there's really no
13:44
reason why your house or your car or
13:46
your land or your personal property
13:47
can't be tokenized there isn't any
13:50
reason why a land owner in India
13:52
couldn't securitize part of their land
13:54
and sell a portion of that in a contract
13:56
directly to consumers with digital
13:59
wallets using fiat stable coins that are
14:01
investing in that contract without any
14:03
intermediary generating dividends and
14:05
yield for that land owner and and and
14:07
obviously creating an investment
14:08
opportunity for consumers and to do that
14:10
with billions of people all around the
14:12
world directly so that's like we're
14:14
right on the cusp of those kinds of
14:16
things being possible obviously there's
14:17
some things in the way in our mind some
14:22
of the big ones include much more mature
14:26
and scalable public blockchains so it's
14:29
really exciting to think about these
14:31
possibilities but if we tried to do any
14:33
of them today it would be extremely
14:35
difficult so we need to have radically
14:38
higher levels of scalability and and
14:42
maturity in the infrastructure and I
14:43
think there's obviously a lot of great
14:45
work going on towards that end and I
14:48
look at this similar to you know the the
14:51
early days or the internet and even the
14:54
early days pre broadband when you know
14:56
people could imagine like streaming HD
14:58
television over the internet but there
15:00
are obviously a lot of steps between
15:01
here and there to get there and I think
15:03
similarly we're gonna have to execute a
15:05
lot of things not just at the technical
15:08
level but even at the policy level to
15:09
make this possible a second piece and
15:11
I'm going to touch on this a little bit
15:12
more is what I call Fiat backs table
15:15
coins I think these are deeply
15:17
fundamental to making this happen
15:19
and I'll talk about why in a sec what I
15:22
would refer to as token marketplaces or
15:24
mature token marketplaces there need to
15:26
be platforms that individuals and
15:30
businesses can use to tokenize their
15:33
things to express the rules of those
15:35
token
15:36
and to exchange them and to have
15:38
liquidity on the exchange of those and
15:39
to do that on a global scale with
15:41
billions of people so token marketplaces
15:45
are in our minds like fundamental market
15:48
infrastructure that need to emerge and
15:49
what we think of as crypto - crypto
15:51
exchanges today are like really really
15:53
early kind of like alpha versions of
15:56
what these token marketplaces could
15:58
become in the future and then finally
16:00
you know a lot of legal and regulatory
16:02
clarity on this vast and diverse range
16:06
of crypto tokens that are emerging
16:08
there's this enormous diversity of how
16:10
you could classify these things and
16:12
whether we like it or not
16:13
governments are gonna have a say in this
16:15
and we have to get clarity and we want
16:17
to get as much clarity as we can so that
16:19
we all know the rules of the road on
16:21
this stuff I said I would mention this a
16:24
little bit more so the importance of
16:25
stable coins I believe that to be
16:28
adopted by mass society by billions of
16:32
people these tokenized assets these
16:35
tokenized crypto securities and the like
16:37
have to be denominated in fiat money at
16:41
least until we have globally accepted
16:43
price stable cryptocurrencies and so
16:46
it's in my view much more likely that we
16:49
will have fiat backed stable coins like
16:52
this year next year the year after
16:54
before the whole world decides no we're
Stablecoins
16:57
just going to adopt price stable
16:59
cryptocurrencies that are not
17:01
government-issued so this is a matter of
17:03
sequencing eventually we very likely
17:05
will have globally accepted try stable
17:07
cryptocurrencies but that's not going to
17:09
happen for a while at least in a mass
17:11
society context and so this is really
17:14
really critical we have to be able to do
17:16
this so the reason why is that if we
17:19
have a form of value equity in my
17:21
company a token in my company a debt a
17:24
relationship between me and you or a
17:27
loan or any form of value exchange that
17:30
needs to be denominated in something and
17:33
it has to be denominated in something
17:34
that will be an acceptable form of money
17:36
and so we believe that any smart
17:41
contract that has that involves sort of
17:43
Fiat value would benefit enormously from
17:45
these Fiat backs table points so this is
17:47
a big piece to
17:49
to the ecosystem that needs to be solved
17:51
and something that we're working on at
17:53
circle as well why tokenize everything
17:56
like what are the benefits why am I so
17:59
passionate about this I mean it some of
18:01
this is really obvious Society deserves
18:05
secure incorruptible data and
18:07
record-keeping systems that's a major
18:11
benefit to the world if we can have
18:12
these incorruptible and very very secure
Benefits
18:16
record-keeping systems once we have this
18:20
kind of tokenization of value it can
18:23
usher in enormous amounts of automation
18:26
in areas of civil and economic activity
18:29
that have been for millennia prone to an
18:33
enormous amount of error and corruption
18:35
and so if we want to eliminate that
18:37
error and improve the efficiency but
18:39
also eradicate corruption having having
18:43
this I think helps and it brings
18:45
significantly greater levels of
18:46
transparency and accountability along
18:48
with it the the bigger thing is that it
18:51
opens up these really exciting new
18:53
avenues of value sharing globally
18:55
between people and each other between
18:57
people and businesses and society as a
18:59
whole the example I gave of a landowner
19:02
in one part of the world securitizing
19:04
their property expressing that in a way
19:06
which can be accessed directly by
19:08
consumers from any part of the planet
19:10
instantly with an economic relationship
19:13
that doesn't have a classic intermediary
19:15
that's involved and does that incredibly
19:18
cheaply and in an open transparent
19:19
accountable way that's really really
19:21
powerful and beneficial and so from my
19:24
perspective why is this exciting it
19:25
ultimately leads to greater levels of
19:28
global integration it ultimately can
19:31
lead to reducing poverty reducing risks
19:33
of war and improving the planet so it's
19:35
a big priority and very exciting thank
19:38
you
19:42

Tokenization:

Intro
0:03
as we previously discussed economies are
0:06
first and foremost about value what
0:09
humans value and how we strive to
0:11
achieve more of the things we value to
0:14
have an economic system the first step
0:16
is to take account this value that
0:18
exists within the system the foundations
0:21
of economics is being able to securely
0:23
represent the underlining resources and
0:26
exchanges within the real economy in
0:28
some information system which we can
0:31
then use to virtually exchange
0:33
analyze or otherwise alter in various
0:35
ways the critical aspect of this process
0:39
is that the information accounting layer
0:41
remains true to the underlining assets
0:44
and exchanges within the real economy of
0:46
course many people will wish to alter
0:49
these records to their advantage and
0:51
thus we need some trusted source for
0:53
maintaining and verifying those records
0:56
previously we've relied upon centralized
0:59
institutions to take account of and
1:01
vouch for the authenticity of these
1:03
records of value however the secure and
1:07
trusted nature of blockchain networks
1:09
makes it possible for us to directly
1:11
associate the value of a real-world
1:13
asset with a programmable assets and we
1:16
call this tokenization tokenization is
1:20
the process of converting rights to
1:22
real-world assets into digital tokens on
1:25
a blockchain previously we could not
What is Tokenization
1:29
create trusted records of value without
1:32
the support of centralized institutions
1:34
creating token systems at large scale
1:37
has previously been the purview of
1:39
states and empires the implication of
1:42
having an automated distributed system
1:45
like the blockchain is that everything
1:47
could be securitized by everyone as we
1:49
greatly expand our capacity to define
1:52
measure and exchange value of all kinds
1:55
we can now set up blockchain networks
1:58
that can store records of value and be
2:00
trusted by members involved without
2:02
anyone actually controlling already
2:05
owning the network the implications of
2:07
this are many folds firstly we no longer
2:11
depend upon lengthy and often expensive
2:14
bureaucratic procedures for the
2:16
history of valued assets people can
2:19
literally securitize their own assets
2:22
and have them validated by the network
2:25
secondly we are no longer confined to
2:28
assets that are large enough to be worth
2:30
some centralized institution recording
2:33
and tracking them with digital
2:35
technology the cost of doing this is so
2:37
low that we can securitize almost
2:39
anything and with personal and mobile
2:42
computing people can do this themselves
2:45
thirdly with paralleled advances in big
2:48
data and pervasive sensing mobile
2:50
computing and social networking were now
2:53
able to track more types of value the
2:55
previously went unaccounted for and
2:58
assigned tokens to them mostly we should
3:02
consider the implications of blockchain
3:04
tokenization as token economies shift
3:07
the locus of power both outwards to the
3:10
individual and the networks that
3:12
maintain these economies previously we
Implications of Tokenization
3:15
invested a massive amount of power and
3:17
control within centralized organizations
3:20
as they were the ones that got to find
3:22
value within society and economy but
3:25
with token economics the management of
3:27
value records and exchanges shifts to
3:30
information based networks with huge
3:32
implications centralized systems Forgan
3:36
ization for the recording and validation
3:38
of assets have advantages but they also
3:41
have their limitations because they're
3:43
centralised they inherently create
3:45
bottlenecks there are a few people in
3:47
the center trying to serve a large
3:49
population if the administration is well
3:52
developed this can work to a certain
3:54
degree Land Registry in places like
3:56
Germany and Singapore may work well but
3:59
for most of the world it doesn't work so
4:01
well in places like India or Africa
4:04
centralized institutions are overwhelmed
4:07
and under-resourced to provide for the
4:09
mass of people and as a consequence the
4:12
majority of our global economy is
4:13
undocumented and informal not having
4:16
access to legal rights financial
4:18
services etc likewise centralized
4:22
systems require many layers of hierarchy
4:25
and regulation to ensure the people are
4:28
ting according to the Mandate of the
4:30
organization as the system gets larger
4:33
more and more layers of bureaucracy
4:34
build up take for example the
4:37
administration of organic farming in a
4:39
country like Islands there may be an
4:42
organization for assessing and
4:44
certifying the farmers which will be
4:46
assessed in turn by some national
4:48
authority which may in turn be assessed
4:51
by the European Union these different
4:53
layers of bureaucracy create high
4:56
overhead costs and overtime built up
4:58
into inert structures the formal
5:02
proceedings of large bureaucratic
5:04
systems is often overbearingly
5:07
complicated and expensive for the
5:08
majority of people to avail of them for
5:11
example if you look at the
5:13
administration that lies behind trying
5:15
to issue a hundred million shares and
5:17
all of the different institutions you
5:19
have to pay to keep shares and register
5:21
them to distribute them keep track of
5:23
them and regulate the whole system it
5:26
takes an enormous amount of work effort
5:28
and costs thus most companies do not get
5:30
access to global capital markets via the
5:33
offering of shares with the tokenization
5:35
of assets they move on to a digital
5:38
exchange where they can be exchanged at
5:41
a very low costs and in very small
5:43
increments something like a building can
5:46
be tokenized and instead of having to
5:48
buy the whole building with huge legal
5:50
and regulatory overhead costs you could
5:52
now purchase one square centimeter of
5:54
the building in seconds with very little
5:56
overhead costs and you could do that
5:58
anywhere on the planets
Value Capture
6:02
thirdly information technology is
6:05
expanding our capacity to quantify value
6:08
and tokenization enables us to capture
6:11
different forms of value social capital
6:14
natural capital financial capital etc
6:16
the thing to appreciate is that this
6:19
goes far beyond the blockchain this
6:21
paradigm shift in economics is possible
6:23
because of very fundamental changes in
6:25
information technology we go far beyond
6:28
blockchain networks themselves a key
6:31
aspect here is data fication the facts
6:34
that we're quantifying and turning more
6:37
and more aspects of our world into data
6:38
and creating what we call big data in a
6:42
world of scarce in firm a ssin we were
6:44
limited in what type of value we could
6:47
quantify and how much we can keep track
6:49
of but in a world of pervasive
6:51
information and communications with Iams
6:54
that we're spontaneously quantifying and
6:56
tracking all sorts of new forms of value
6:59
that previously went unaccounted for
7:01
social networking is but one good
7:04
example of this token systems enable us
7:08
to ascribe value to everything that we
7:10
value and create markets around that's
7:13
one of the great advantages of token
7:15
economies is that we can create token
7:18
networks for the things that people
7:19
value in our existing economy we're
7:23
fully dependent upon centralized
7:25
institutions to define value centralized
7:28
organizations will only do things that
7:30
are in their interests if something is
7:33
not in the mandate or interests of a
7:35
centralized organization we find that it
7:37
will not get done we may find that it is
7:40
not in the interests of any centralized
7:42
organization to remove the trash from
7:45
the side of the road but by creating a
7:47
token system we can incentivize people
7:49
to clear the rubbish in the traditional
7:53
free-market system we may not be able to
7:55
place a value on the functionality of an
7:57
ecosystem and the government authorities
7:59
may have every incentive to simply sell
8:02
out the nation's natural resources but
8:04
by creating an eco token we could try to
8:07
capture and manage that value of beer
8:10
distributed token network take for
8:13
example a plastic
8:14
Bank plastic Bank is a social enterprise
8:16
that creates environmental impact in
8:19
areas with high levels of poverty and
8:22
plastic pollution by turning plastic
8:24
waste into a cryptocurrency by enabling
8:27
the exchange of plastic for blockchain
8:29
secure digital tokens they reveal the
8:32
value of plastic this empowers recycling
8:35
ecosystems around welds and stops the
8:38
flow of plastic into the ocean by
8:40
creating a market that connects those
8:42
who use plastic waste for recycling and
8:44
those who have time to collect him thus
8:47
working to manage this system through a
8:49
distributed token markets the capacity
8:53
for communities of people to directly
8:55
define what they value and create
8:57
economies around lats without depending
9:00
upon a centralized organization to do
9:02
that for them is a true revolution it is
9:05
truly a restructuring of the very fabric
9:07
of our societies with massive
9:09
implications and repercussions that will
9:12
take decades to play outs it removes
9:15
current bottlenecks that have limited
9:17
the availability of formal economic and
9:19
financial structures to a small minority
9:22
of the global population and make it
9:24
possible to extend the most advanced and
9:26
sophisticated legal frameworks and
9:28
market mechanisms to everyone on the
9:30
planet it enables us to extend the
9:34
exchange of value and market mechanisms
9:36
to very small high volume exchanges such
9:39
as between machines and computers it
9:41
enables communities to define what it is
9:44
that they value instead of that being
9:46
decided measured and managed by a
9:49
centralized Authority and as we'll
9:51
discuss in future modules it allows us
9:54
to incorporate a broader spectrum of
9:56
values into market exchanges Primavera
9:59
de Filippi communicates this well when
10:02
she says so everyone has different value
10:04
systems and every community or every
10:07
organization embodies those values
10:09
systems but today we only have one way
10:12
of actually transferring this value
10:14
around and that's through fiat currency
10:16
the idea is actually to have a
10:19
multiplicity so right now we have a
10:22
monopoly of value sets which is the
10:24
market value sets
10:26
and if we can create new values with the
10:28
new value system which are basically
10:30
represented by those tokens on the
10:33
blockchain
10:33
but in facts were these is the ability
10:36
for communities to express what they
10:39
value by transferring tokens

Introduction
0:03
with the ongoing revolution in
0:05
information technology our economic
0:07
systems of organization are being
0:09
transformed and disrupted by the rise of
0:11
information networks it started with the
0:14
advent of the personal computer World
0:17
Wide Web and with the rise of online
0:19
platforms the disruptive power of
0:21
information networks to reshape economic
0:23
organization became ever more apparent
0:26
today this process of economic
0:29
transformation continues with a new set
0:31
of technologies as we are currently in
0:33
the process of remaking the technology
0:35
stack of the Internet building what is
0:38
called web 3.0 a primary component of
0:41
which is the blockchain
0:42
the defining feature of this next stage
0:45
of economic development is that it
0:47
decentralizes our economy and shifts
0:49
operations to global information based
0:52
networks like never before
0:57
Internet technology stack that is
0:58
currently being built enables a network
1:00
of computers to maintain a collective
1:02
database of value ownership and
1:04
exchanges via Internet protocols this
1:08
bookkeeping is neither closed nor the
1:10
control of one party rather it is public
1:14
and available in one digital ledger
1:16
which is distributed across the network
1:18
the most mature example of this is what
1:21
we call the blockchain in the blockchain
1:25
all transactions are logged including
1:27
information on the date time
1:29
participants and amount of every single
1:32
transaction on the basis of
1:35
sophisticated mathematical principles
1:37
the transactions are verified by the so
1:39
called miners who run the computing
1:41
infrastructure required to maintain the
1:44
Ledger's
1:46
the technology of web 3.0 enables a new
1:49
form of decentralized economy as it
1:51
removes the dependency on a centralized
1:54
authority for managing the network
1:56
instead replacing it with a distributed
1:58
consensus model managed by many this
2:03
shared securely encrypted database
2:05
enables trustless peer-to-peer
2:07
interactions via new internet protocols
2:10
people can begin to set up their own
2:12
networks for coordination and direct
2:14
exchanges of value peer-to-peer and it
2:17
enables the rules of these transactions
2:19
to be automated in new ways
Tokens
2:25
at the heart of this system is the
2:27
distributed ledger which records the
2:29
exchanges of value these distributed
2:32
Ledger's can account for and validate
2:34
the exchange of any form of value it may
2:38
be a currency it may be property it may
2:41
be a kilowatt hour of energy the usage
2:43
of a parking spot the number of
2:45
followers a person has on social media
2:48
these distributed Ledger's provide the
2:51
infrastructure for building token
2:53
economies a token is simply a quantified
2:56
unit of value tokens are both generic
3:00
and fungible it is generic in that it
3:03
can be used to define any form of value
3:05
and it is fungible meaning it is
3:07
exchangeable between different specific
3:09
forms of value
3:12
traditional monetary currencies are not
3:14
fully fungible as there are many
3:16
circumstances when one cannot exchange a
3:18
monetary currency for other forms of
3:20
value for example likes on social media
3:24
may have a certain value but typically
3:26
cannot be directly exchanged for
3:28
monetary currencies
3:31
a token differs from our traditional
3:33
monetary currency and that it is more
3:35
generic our existing currencies define a
3:39
particular type of monetary value what
3:41
we call utility which is based upon the
3:44
economic logic of the industrial economy
3:46
while tokens because they are more
3:49
generic can define a broader set of
3:51
values social capital natural capital or
3:54
cultural capital for example natural
3:58
capital is the integrity of an ecosystem
4:00
that enables it to function and provide
4:03
ecosystems services to people in our
4:07
traditional economic model we only
4:09
quantify and account for the services
4:12
that the ecosystem delivers such as food
4:14
water materials etc however we do not
4:19
account for the integrity of the
4:20
ecosystem that enables it to function
4:23
the generic nature of the token means it
4:26
can be used to account for values such
4:28
as this natural capital
4:31
the capacity to differentiate between
4:34
different forms of value is made
4:36
possible by the programmability of token
4:38
units because tokens are digital
4:41
they are also programmable which enables
4:44
one to specify certain rules for that
4:46
token and have those rules executed when
4:48
it is exchanged thus enabling certain
4:51
constraints or possibilities in its
4:53
usage one can specify that a certain
4:57
token is only spendable under certain
4:59
terms or specify how it can be converted
5:02
for example one could program the tokens
5:06
so that it cannot be exchanged for
5:07
diamonds that are mined in a particular
5:09
location of the world known for its use
5:12
of slave labor in this way the token is
5:15
not just a unit of utility but also
5:17
expresses social values
5:20
likewise one could create a healthcare
5:22
allowance in dollars or Euros that could
5:24
be programmed on the blockchain so that
5:26
it can only be used to pay for
5:28
healthcare at certified parties
5:31
automating these measures leads to a
5:33
considerable decrease in bureaucracy
5:35
this programmable token system works to
5:39
shift our economies from a single value
5:41
model to a multi value model they create
5:44
many different types of value and
5:45
economies but still retain the
5:47
possibility for exchange between them
The Distributed Web
5:54
the distributed web is the convergence
5:56
of the economic market system with
5:58
information technology that enables us
6:01
to convert traditional organizations
6:03
into distributed markets based on tokens
6:05
tokens define whatever is a value within
6:09
that organization and the market system
6:11
is used as a distributed coordination
6:13
mechanism for managing and growing that
6:15
resource
6:18
by creating an expanded definition of
6:20
value and converting closed
6:22
organizations into open markets this
6:24
means that we can vastly expand the
6:26
scope and capacities of the economy the
6:29
provisioning of services within the
6:31
economy no longer becomes dependent upon
6:33
a limited number of centralized
6:35
organizations acting for profit but
6:37
instead anyone can now provide the
6:40
service via these open protocols this
6:43
means we can harness the resources of
6:45
the many in a distributed fashion
6:47
instead of being dependent upon a few
6:50
likewise the token economy can harness
6:52
the motives of individuals not just for
6:55
financial rewards but for a multiplicity
6:57
of values
7:00
to illustrate how this works let's think
7:02
about the service of cloud data storage
7:04
currently this is provided by a limited
7:07
number of enterprises like Amazon and
7:09
Microsoft these centralized
7:12
organizations have huge data centers but
7:15
still those data centers are only a very
7:17
small fraction of the storage capacity
7:19
in the world most of the storage is in
7:22
the personal computing devices of
7:23
end-users and most of that is not being
7:26
used a file coin is one organization
7:30
that works to create a distributed token
7:32
economy for this storage file coin is a
7:36
decentralized storage network that turns
7:38
cloud storage into an algorithmic market
7:41
the market runs on a blockchain with a
7:44
native protocol token also called file
7:47
coin which miners earned by providing
7:49
storage to clients conversely clients
7:53
spend file coins hiring miners to store
7:56
or distribute data the sum of all these
7:59
computers that are coordinated through
8:01
an automatic market system on the
8:02
blockchain can provide a much larger
8:05
more resilient system than the
8:07
centralized model while reducing
8:08
redundancy and inefficiencies in the
8:11
overall system it also pushes the
8:14
provision of the service out to the
8:16
location where it is demanded as people
8:18
are connecting peer-to-peer locally
8:20
instead of going to the centralized
8:22
server that may be on the other side of
8:24
the planet
Token Ownership
8:27
tokens such as file coins can be
8:30
exchanged for other currencies or
8:32
members can hold on to their tokens
8:34
whose value may appreciate as the
8:36
networks grow over time
8:39
this illustrates a very interesting
8:41
aspect to tokens anyone who uses the
8:44
system is also an investor in the system
8:46
thus tokens merge investment capital and
8:49
liquid exchange capital in new ways in
8:53
the traditional capitalist model we have
8:55
a divide between owners of capital and
8:58
workers a divide between a more fixed
9:01
investment capital and liquid exchange
9:03
currencies the shares in a company are
9:07
not the same thing as what people get
9:08
paid with for working in that enterprise
9:10
and use for everyday exchanges in the
9:12
market this creates the notorious divide
9:16
within the industrial economy described
9:18
by Karl Marx between the capitalists
9:21
that make money off their investments
9:23
and the workers that have to stay
9:25
selling their labor for money without
9:27
ownership
9:30
tokens represent both the inherent value
9:32
of the community which is its capital
9:35
investments and they are also units of
9:37
exchange within that ecosystem the
9:40
founders of the project issue a number
9:42
of tokens at inception and sell those
9:44
for someone to use the system they have
9:47
to buy the tokens in so doing they
9:49
become part investors in the project but
9:52
they also use those same tokens to make
9:54
exchanges within the market thus the
9:57
people creating the value in the
9:59
ecosystem are also getting paid in
10:01
tokens meaning the workers that are
10:03
creating the value through their work
10:05
also have ownership within the
10:07
organization
10:09
in the traditional utility-based
10:11
exchange of cash people have no
10:14
ownership in the organization they just
10:16
try to make money and this can create
10:18
divides between the owners and the users
10:21
the token system works to better align
10:23
the incentives of the individuals with
10:25
the overall system because the value of
10:27
the tokens they earn is also dependent
10:30
upon the value of the whole when you are
10:33
working for a token network you are both
10:35
working for yourself and for the whole
10:37
organization as the to become more
10:39
aligned unlike the traditional divide
10:41
between capitalist and worker
Token System
10:47
the token system enables networks to
10:49
overcome the chicken-and-egg problem if
10:53
you are the first user of a network like
10:55
eBay then the value would be very low
10:57
thus it is difficult to get the network
10:59
started because it has to reach a
11:01
critical mass before it will be of value
11:03
to the users this means that it may
11:06
require a large investment to create a
11:08
network the Silicon Valley model worked
11:11
by having large initial venture capital
11:13
backing that enables them to overcome
11:15
this but it means that most networks
11:18
don't get off the ground and that once a
11:20
network reaches scale and has value it
11:23
becomes dominant and very difficult to
11:25
compete with resulting in a lock-in
11:28
effect and making it easy for large
11:31
incumbent organizations to become
11:32
extractive over time it also means that
11:36
those who founded the organization win
11:38
big time if the network takes off it
11:41
creates a winner-takes-all dynamic with
11:44
most people losing because of the
11:45
threshold
11:48
the token system extends the benefits as
11:50
being an early adopter of a new network
11:52
to all the users and thus helps to solve
11:55
this issue it does this by issuing
11:58
tokens for anyone to purchase at the
12:00
beginning of the project as the project
12:02
grows the tokens come to have greater
12:04
value for all of the holders
12:07
this also works to make the users of the
12:10
network promoters of that organization
12:12
because as it grows the tokens that they
12:14
hold become more valuable it
12:17
incentivizes people to join networks
12:19
early so as to gain the benefits of the
12:21
increase in their token value as it
12:23
grows which reduces the problem of
12:25
thresholds with this technology
12:29
companies no longer have to go to
12:30
traditional capital markets through an
12:32
initial public offering of shares in the
12:34
company in exchange for money but
12:36
instead they simply sell tokens directly
12:39
on the Internet to raise initial capital
12:41
for the project in what is called an
12:43
initial coin offering or IC o----
12:46
this means that founders can monetize
12:49
their networks directly by simply
12:51
holding their tokens and making the
12:53
network useful
12:57
to date we have had an Internet patched
12:59
onto the side of an economy operated
13:01
through the many centralized
13:03
organizations of the Industrial Age
13:05
creating a strong contradiction between
13:07
the underlying technology and the
13:09
institutional arrangements the
13:12
distributed web will work to transform
13:14
this by merging information networks and
13:17
economic organization as the flow of
13:19
information an economic value becomes
13:21
one this will greatly reduce our
13:24
dependency on centralized organizations
13:27
expanding markets as systems of
13:29
organization the global market economy
13:32
will become available to the many
13:33
through small distributed peer-to-peer
13:36
interactions running through web
13:38
protocols as the decentralized internet
13:40
takes us a step further into the
13:42
networked economy

Introduction
0:00
maybe before we start I'd like to get a feeling of who you guys are and and then
0:05
I think we'll keep the session like half an hour and then we can have some Q&A
0:11
and some discussion I I find that this is often very valuable could you just tell me who you are and why you're here
0:17
yeah yeah oh yes that's true thank you it's on right hello my name is
0:26
Antoni I'm working for Ivan 3 that it's an identity project although I'm coming
0:32
from from the economic world I mean I'm an economist okay also I work for Deutsche Bank and then I'm interested to
0:39
see which is in the ABS behind about this concept good hello my name is
0:47
George I'm working in Cambodia an organization organization research and
0:55
education and I'm just coming here to London for a month and I'm just
1:00
attending as many conferences in blockchain so I can learn as much as I can and see any application value in
1:06
Southeast Asia hello I'm Pascal Isabel we met yesterday
1:14
I'm an investor in indirectly in Berlin innovation ventures about we renamed
1:21
lunar where you're a venture partner so your colleague introduced introduced us
1:27
yesterday and I thought the topic of your book was very good so my background
1:32
is I'm basically a stockbroker by background I've been raising money for a lot of tech companies for the last 15
1:38
years I'm also an on the investment committee of isomer Capital a venture fund of funds and we've got several blockchain
1:44
investments and David Foshay of fo ship for shape sorry of of cut what's the
1:53
name of the firm anyway he's he's got a he's one of the co-sponsors of this
1:59
event and he's invited me along so I can learn as much as I can about blockchain good thank you hello my name is
2:08
Christina I have a product marketing background
2:13
I'm still learning about blockchain and cryptocurrencies and as I told you
2:19
before ever interesting in the token economics so I look for for you
2:24
good talk thank you you're here I guess we're just introducing ourselves yeah very quickly since we're such a private
2:31
round that my name is Toby I work at Knossos I have an engineering background
2:36
but working in product right now I'm working there since beginning of last
2:42
year and yeah I thought the topic of your sock was very interesting and
2:48
basically I'm curious no other expectations right now okay well welcome
2:53
and oh and I'm very happy to be here because I think this new technology this
3:01
token is a digital derivative that is managed by a blockchain
3:06
and it will potentially change drastically change the dynamics of our
3:12
economic system and I'd like to give an introduction of why I think this is the
3:17
case so what is token economics right if
History of the Internet
3:22
we think of if we look into the history of the Internet we can think of the early days of the
3:30
what we called world wide web the web one from from from today's perspective it was like hello world it
3:37
revolutionized communication it connected standalone computers and it brought us what we call the information
3:44
economy or as some might remember information data Highway a fun word that
3:49
was used in the early 90s nobody would use that word because it has become so normal that we're interconnected so this
3:58
revolutionized communication but the internet was still people what it did we
4:04
we had the internet before the 90s and so the internet wasn't didn't just
4:10
wasn't invented in the 90s we had the internet since the early sixties actually or mid sixties but it most
4:20
people didn't have computers and and when we had the computer revolution in the 80s these computers were standalone
4:26
and if they were interconnected you would need to know command line computer
4:32
language to be able to connect to another computer so it wasn't the usability wasn't there only few people
4:39
have the knowledge to kind of communicate with other commute computers
4:44
that were somewhere else so what the World Wide Web brought us what Tim berners-lee brought us was a hypertext
4:50
markup language that made it easy with a few lines of code to create a website that was visually appealing and allowed
4:57
anyone and a laymen and laywomen with a few clicks to surf the web so it made
5:04
the internet usable and it made it easy to create a website with a few lines of code and how the problem was that most
5:11
people even if they learned HTML which is not really a very sophisticated programming language they wouldn't know
5:19
what to put on those websites so for those again who remember the early 90s many websites for a long time would say
5:26
hello world that would be the first thing you would people would write on the website because they were like hey I
5:31
created a web page but it would only say hello world so it took us a while and
5:38
the earliest websites were directories
5:43
online directories that pointed to other pages and so the the earliest use case
5:49
of some more sophisticated web sites were search engines how do I find information in that sea of information
5:57
so it took us around 10 years until the web 2 emerged and the web who wasn't a
6:04
revolution it was an evolution it made a the internet more usable more interactive the developer stack became
6:11
also more sophisticated but it took us
6:16
ten years also until we found out how we can kind of apply different types of
6:22
websites right so a website it took us 10 years to understand that a website is not a website that that some websites
6:30
are for e-commerce and other websites are for social media and other websites
6:35
maybe we can use them to share knowledge like for example Wikipedia so that brought us the platform economy
6:42
and some notion of how to kind of the different use cases of how to use
6:49
websites in this context the the web 3 in blockchain and really is the driving
6:56
force of this next-generation Internet it's a back-end revolution it doesn't really change much at the front end of
7:02
what's happening online but the way we manage our data and verify transactions
7:08
and manage values this is revolutionised in the backend of the internet and the
7:13
application of this new Internet is our tokens so what is a token and what is
7:22
this new token economy the web 3 enables tokens are not a new thing and the native speakers know that the English
What are tokens
7:29
language has many applications or many use cases for different types of tokens
7:35
we've had asset tokens ever since we use shells for as a kind
7:41
of medium exchange of exchange but we have tokens we use tokens when we go to
7:46
the casino we have tokens like any bonus miles of your airline would be a token
7:52
some coffee machine tokens some Metro tokens to take the subway in New York some gift certificates etc etc so many
8:01
different types of asset tokens have existed tokens also have existed in the computing world to manage operations or
8:10
access rights and they could manifest as a QR code or for example a personal
8:15
tracking code and we've used for example this is another example of tokens that have been used in cognitive psychology
8:23
as positive reinforcement tools to incentivize kind of behavior and
8:28
psychiatric wards have been experimenting for example in the 50s in the u.s. to change patient behavior
8:38
alternatively instead of just doing some kind of cognitive or kind of talking
8:43
speech therapy at et cetera they rewarded them with tokens if they prove
8:48
that they changed their behavior and that they could use those tokens which would represent some kind the vasa token that you could use for
8:55
some Hospital services like special privileges to watch the television or
9:01
get better food now why our blockchain tokens such a revolution because it's
Why blockchain tokens
9:07
not a new thing right but these tokens are quite costly to issue and manage
9:14
because you need to make sure that these tokens are copyright protected any fee
9:21
of money I just got 20 pounds for this book I'm selling paper for paper right this is a
9:27
token and we need to make sure when we issue tokens that you cannot copy them
9:33
and this management is anti counter fighting protection cost a lot of money
9:38
this is a kind of money and time in tents and this is the beauty of
The beauty of blockchain tokens
9:43
blockchain tokens we can issue them with a few lines of code as a smart contract
9:49
or with a smart contract for example and kind of its we can issue these tokens
9:56
and they're collectively managed the tokens or the state of the tokens is collectively managed by a blockchain
10:02
network it's a public infrastructure that can be completely public it could be some a private it could be a
10:08
Federation but we can now manage these tokens the state of these tokens at much
10:14
lower costs so issuing and managing tokens has become as as cheap as maybe
10:19
in the in the 90s issuing and managing an online billboard this is how people
10:26
referred to websites in the 90s they explained them as online billboards now
10:33
a token contract is a special type of smart contract for example on the etherium blockchain and it manages
10:40
access rights to either something you own or something somebody else owns or a collective owns so that's it it's a
10:49
rights management tool to some kind of value that can be temporary or permanent until you sell this value it's it's
10:58
managed by what we call a software wallet which is a piece of software that's connected to some kind of
11:03
distributed ledger that manages and and the tokens are of course never
11:08
in the wallet only your private key is in this wallet this is why it's better to refer to this as not a wallet but
11:17
they're teaching while it really is a very very misleading term all right so
How many tokens are out there
11:22
if we look at the state of the token economy today maybe quick question do you know how many tokens have been
11:29
issued until today some okay four or
11:35
five thousand was one answer all right so if we look at corn market cap this is
11:42
a public website that where you can see all the publicly listed trader tokens it's around two thousand five hundred
11:48
tokens that are publicly traded but these are special type of fungible and
11:53
transferable tokens it's not all tokens out there these are the tokens that we can treat a very special type of token
12:00
if you go on the block Explorer and look
12:07
at what's happening in the serial main net you we can see that roughly two
12:12
hundred thousand token contracts have been issued on the etherium minute that's the main it only that's not the
12:19
test net and that's not any other type of blockchain or distributed ledger where you can also issue tokens now many
12:25
of those tokens on the etherium may not have been issued for test reasons or maybe not but are not functional or
12:32
operational but some are but they could be identity tokens so you're not trading them so just looking at coin market cap
12:39
doesn't give you an indication of how many tokens are are out there so the future is happening we already have
12:45
hundreds and thousands of tokens issued for some limited use case maybe but this
12:50
is happening and and very interesting now the problem is that yes the issuance
The problem with tokens
12:57
of tokens has become very easy and cheap but one of the greatest challenges is
13:03
that most people have no idea what you do like okay I can issue a token but what type of token what's the what's the
13:10
purpose of the token what are the properties what properties do my tokens need to have and the properties are
13:17
derived from the purpose so the question really is a question of business model or governance model so
13:23
what do I want to do with this token again if we look into the early 90s people were confused what they could do
13:30
with websites and it took us some time to realize what we can do with them so
13:35
the first question is what is the purpose and then I derived my functions
Classification of tokens
13:41
so what we're doing at the Research Institute where we've been trying to do some classification and taxonomies we
13:48
try to move away from this very simplistic classification of calling
13:54
tokens utility tokens and I don't know security tokens and some kind of other
14:00
token that's one perspective to look at tokens and that's a regulator in perspective but it's not very useful
14:07
when you want to design a tokens so a designing a token you first have to ask for the purpose now we've tried to come
14:17
up with some basic classification and we identified that we have simple tokens
14:23
what we call simple token systems and complex token systems simple token systems would be token systems or types
14:30
of tokens that represent any type of asset or axis right that we know today a
14:35
ticket to a concert take care of any airline ticket any sharing of a company
14:41
any type of yeah any any type of asset
14:47
or access right real or virtual we know these things we can kind of tokenize a
14:53
Picasso painting fractionalize it that's basically an asset right these and we
15:00
call them simple token systems because we know these business models this is
15:05
nothing new and mostly not very complex obviously there are some techno technical issues in tokenizing these
15:12
things but it mostly requires techno legal engineering because it's things we
15:18
already know and the greatest question is how what is the legal engineering around this so we
15:24
make it compliant with the legal system we have today it doesn't require a whole lot of kind of it requires a little bit
15:32
of technique engineering but it really doesn't require a lot of kind of economic
15:37
engineering the second class of token systems would be complex token systems they're interesting and we or I refer to
15:47
them as purpose-driven tokens and there is a whole chapter in my book on that these purpose-driven tokens and an
15:54
example for a purpose-driven token is Bitcoin itself actually they enable
16:00
purpose purpose driven networks and the purpose of Bitcoin is peer-to-peer money
16:05
without kind of intermediaries and these purpose driven tokens enable complex
16:11
systems and they require mainly economic engineering and this is also what we
Access rights
16:17
focus on in our kind of research at the university so before we get into the
16:24
complex token systems maybe a step back to the kind of simple token systems any
16:30
kind of acid or access rights so token could be a kilowatt hour of energy a fiat currency represent a commodity
16:36
maybe some reputation a promise for a product in their crowdfunding an
16:42
insurance policy in ticket to event a download of a song which would be
16:48
something I own but if I stream a song it would be an axis right right or for example rewards program in a
16:55
loyalty kind of airline loyalty program
17:00
would be an exchangeable asset and rewards program if they kind of give you
17:08
an asset with which you can buy some your next ticket or get a reduction on your ticket it would be an asset but if
17:15
that bonus point is simply gets gives you access rights to some kind of
17:21
senator launch then it would be an excess right right so as access rights
17:26
we have tokens that represent some kind of software license voting rights stock
17:33
certificates etc so many many use cases of things we already know and we can now
17:38
we now have a new cryptographic derivative to represent these things one
Stable tokens
17:44
of the more interesting use cases are they tokens because most of these tokens or
17:50
some people refer to them as cryptocurrencies I'd rather refer to them as tokens technically they're tokens and then we can see like other
17:57
more currencies what kind of properties do they have so stable tokens have been
18:03
emerging over the last two years and there are many many different ways to
18:09
provide for a stable token it's also a whole chapter in the book and we can see
18:15
that this is really a thing because obviously we need stability of price for a medium of exchange and we can see that
18:21
with Libra and Facebook announcing Libra beginning of this summer they really
18:28
announced a new area of the web 3 because if you have an internet giant
18:33
like Facebook with 2.4 billion users announcing a stable token and their own
18:41
kind of private infrastructure they want to manage this on this means that this
18:46
token economy is happening I think the more interesting part are these complex
Bitcoin
18:53
token systems Bitcoin for example is enables a complex token system and what
19:02
people most people don't usually talk about media refers to Bitcoin as an
19:09
object of speculation sometimes digital gold sometimes cryptocurrency and I think this is a complete miss
19:17
interpretation of what Bitcoin really is yes it's also a token that represents an asset that is the can be an object of
19:24
speculation but it was designed for a very very different purpose Bitcoin was
19:30
designed to enable a purpose-driven network appear to pure payment network and the Bitcoin token is incentives
19:39
designed to incentivize and reward productive actions in the network and
19:44
the Bitcoin token allows us to move away from how our society organizes itself
19:53
today to how society might organize itself more in a network structure this
19:59
is also an to work in the end but it's a hierarchical network and this is more flat network this network is has some
20:07
very high top-down management there is one legal entity there are employment contracts that regulate the interaction
20:13
of the people within the system the Bitcoin network doesn't have a
20:21
centralized entity there are no employment contract it's a distributed network of autonomous stakeholders who
20:27
don't know each other who don't trust each other who live in different countries who have no contractual
20:33
agreements with each other and they're all steered by this token and it's a purpose-driven token which enables the
20:40
purpose-driven network and kind of the mechanism behind it is what we call proof of work in Bitcoin it makes sure
20:48
it's designed in a way it assumes that it's it's an open public network of
20:53
untrusted actors so it's designed in a way it assumes it is it's based on the
20:59
assumption that everybody every actor is corrupt and we still the incentive mechanism is designed in a way that it's
21:05
really really expensive to cheat the system and this economic engineering is
21:11
quite complex and this is what we focus on and I think this is what is the more
21:17
interesting part of this new token economy because we can now learn from
21:22
Bitcoin and create other purpose-driven tokens Bitcoin or aetherium in the
21:30
etherium token they are designed to incentivize a universal state layer of
21:37
who owned what in the network but we can design tokens in a way so they
21:42
incentivize kind of social media contributions with good curation kind of
21:49
curation tokens in the form of maybe token curated registries we can design
21:55
tokens to incentivize attention through the and an example here would be the
22:01
basic intention token although I think that the design of of the basic attention token in particular might not
22:07
be the best or we can incentivize co2 emission reductions the way and we're
22:13
doing that in Vienna we're currently working with the city of Vienna to incentivize co2 emission
22:18
reduction by issuing a Vienna token and then you can then exchange this token
22:24
for cultural activities it's in the fetal stages but it's happening so as I
Attention Token
22:29
said basic attention token very interesting use case you will find a chapter in the book of I think they have
22:36
a very interesting value proposition they might not succeed in the long term because they're mixing up a few economic
22:43
mechanisms but what they're trying to do is very interesting because they're
22:49
reversing the role of the whole marketing electronic marketing ecosystem and you can get rewarded directly
22:56
through your wallet for consuming ads by getting rewarded with the attention
Steam Token
23:03
tokens another interesting token use case or purpose-driven token use case would be steam it it's interesting because it's
23:10
been operational for over three years it has over 1 million registered users I don't think they will survive in the
23:17
long term it has serious design flaws which are also addressed in the book but
23:22
I think it's a very interesting use case to understand where this token economy
23:28
is leading us and this both the attention token and steam it are also very interesting use cases to understand
23:35
why Facebook announced the Libre token because they announced the Libre token as a stable token but if they get
23:42
through legislation I'm quite sure they are the next thing they will announce is an attention token and a reputation
23:47
token and they will build on kind of those kind of the path steam it has kind
23:56
of prepared and the basic attention token has prepared yes in Vienna as I
CoolTool Token
24:02
said we're working with the city of Vienna to on a prototype called the cool tool token a cultural token where you
24:09
get rewarded for culture for if you can prove it's kind of proof of co2 emission
24:14
reduction and we're building an app where you can track motion trail we're
24:20
using motion tracking apps to see if people how they move through the city and if they're this YouTube footprint is
24:27
positive they'll get for every so-and-so kilogram of co2 emission reduction they get a few
24:34
tokens and then they can use the tokens for cultural activities so this is a test pilot we're in the design stage
24:41
early 2020 there should be some prototype out there so the interesting
Purposedriven tokens
24:47
thing about purpose-driven tokens is that they introduced a completely new
24:54
type of value creation and I think if you want to understand the web 3 and the disruptive character it cannot that the
25:01
of the web 3 you need to understand this
25:06
because if you remember Bitcoin incentivizes individual action towards a
25:13
collective goal and this is a and in the absence of intermediaries and this is
25:19
quite a new thing because our current economic system is basically focuses on
25:26
private goods and you're incentivized to create private Goods and to consume kind
25:34
of private goods right who knows actually this matrix this is
25:40
an actually alone Elinor Ostrom and economists came up with this public good
25:46
theory of different types of private goods and public goods and common goods and club Goods and she also got a Nobel
25:54
price for her economic work on that and basically there was a lot of criticism
26:01
of net external effects of the way our current economic system works there are
26:07
many external effects on common goods that are not accounted for etcetera etc but to cut a long story short what
26:16
purpose-driven tokens do and I think that's fascinating and we want to research this more the incentivize
26:23
individual action towards a collective goal so kind of there's it's a new type
26:28
of value of creation mechanism that transcends this whole old and my opinion
26:33
outdated communism versus capitalism debate and this is something we should look at and it's rooted in what we
26:41
already know and we call the sharing economy it's like we already saw it in the web -
26:47
people are moving away from wanting to own stuff and they just want to be able
26:52
to access stuff and this is now the sharing economy on steroids incentivizing you directly with a token
26:59
in the absence of any intermediaries what will that do with our economic system is the big question so if we look
Systems
27:08
at and why am I talking about systems and I think maybe many of you today some
27:13
investors I know a lot of business people some researchers but our current economic system thinks very limited and
27:20
functional like input/output and very trying to see the world from a very
27:26
simple perspective that has been very useful for a while but it's not useful for more complex matters and if we look
27:33
at our assumption is that in the end a blockchain network is a system it's a
27:40
complex system in particular a social economic system right economic systems are part of social systems are the UK
27:47
Austria where I'm from obviously this nation-state it's a social system but
27:53
within that social system we have an economic system and we govern this economic system through top-down
27:59
management of our institutions and what we're assuming is that these blockchain
28:05
systems are complex socio-economic systems that are much more similar to nation-states than to companies so the
28:12
tools that we will need to steer these networks whether it's a blockchain infrastructure or a purpose-driven token
28:19
that incentivizes co2 emission reduction or a token curated registry it's a
28:24
network that transcends natural boundaries of people who are who want to run at the same direction they have the
28:31
same purpose and the same goal and we want to incentivize these incentives mechanisms have much more to do with
28:37
micro and macro economics than with business administration questions so what we've learned in the 20th century
28:44
like personnel management marketing I don't know supply chain management it's it's still
28:50
interesting questions but we need to address much more complex questions
28:55
and I think we need to hire more micro economists macro economist Network theories graph people who understand
29:02
graph theory because this is what our infrastructure is building upon so these
Complex Systems
29:07
complex system the the the difference between these top-down organizations and
29:13
the complex system is that the system behavior cannot easily be implied from
29:20
kind of the state change of one or two actors and obviously large organizations
29:28
also tend to be complex systems but they have these very rigid command and control bureaucratic institutions that
29:35
try to control this the chaos so the the
29:40
problem is that if we take if we look at the token economy or this network economy with this Web 3 that is emerging
29:48
I think that if we if we apply reductionist tools that do not kind of
29:54
address these complex issues appropriately that characterized them at
30:00
noise we will have inappropriate tools to understand and to steer what is
30:05
happening the cool thing about these for example block chain networks right
Block Chain Networks
30:11
blockchain is a network it has a bit steered by the protocol and then it also has a token which is kind of the
30:18
currency of this distributed internet tribe so it comes in three layers and
30:23
the cool thing about this blockchain network is that it's an economic system
30:29
that provides us with almost real-time a rich data set our current economic
30:36
system like for example the economic system of the European Union or maybe of
30:41
the UK we don't have rich in real-time data set so economists trying to steer
30:46
our national economies or for example the European Union economy they usually
30:52
built their mechanisms on data that's outdated and and that's not completely
30:58
representative or anything near to real-time and the very interesting thing
31:04
here is that these networks come with real-time data sets and if we take that and combine it with
31:11
the advances in data science that we've seen over the last years we can still
31:19
have come up with new mechanisms to steer this economic systems that come
31:25
with this rich data set and this is what we refer to economic systems engineering and so proof-of-work was the first step
Economic Systems Engineering
31:33
to enable kind of economic steering of an kind of autonomous network of
31:39
untrusted actors but I think we can do better and this is what we're working on at our Institute and we're creating this
31:47
new academic discipline that we're we're calling economic system engineering and
31:53
we're combining economic methods with engineering rigorous engineering methods
31:58
control theory all these methods that engineers have been using for decades to
32:05
build kind of mission critical systems like rockets or bridges and the type of
32:13
rigor that's been applied and the economic and the engineering ethics that
32:19
have been applied to build these mission critical systems is much more rigorous than what we've been using in classical
32:25
economics and this rich data set and the advances in data science allow us to
32:32
combine economic methods with engineering methods to enable the steering and regulation of these complex
32:39
systems so what we're saying is that the
Token Economics
32:46
question is is token economics a new type of economics obviously token
32:51
economics is a such a subset of economics it's not this new thing it
32:58
studies the interactions of and the institutions and the policies of all the
33:03
production and distribution and consumption of goods and services that have been tokenized and the numbers I
33:10
gave you before very clearly show that we're moving towards a full tokenization
33:15
potentially of our whole economy of everything we're already doing today including all the new goods and services
33:23
that we will be offering so yes its economics but it will probably have
33:29
there are a whole set of new dynamics and this chart is very interesting it
33:35
shows you who's an economist here there was one economist right so as you
33:41
know there are many different economic schools some of which are contradictory
33:46
some of which are overlapping and it's you and it doesn't stop here because there is a second part to this light
33:53
this is the lower part we have many many because very often engineers come to us and they're like oh we want you
33:59
what's the inflation rate which you should do for our token and they're already post ico raised two hundred
34:05
million and now they want to know from us how to do like how to kind of set their inflation right and we're like
34:12
well and and we need an economist I mean like what type of economist do you need right microeconomics macroeconomics what
34:19
are your economic assumptions what is your system and very often we find that these people and that's very important
34:26
that are building these really really amazing blockchain infrastructures they're engineers that look only
34:34
input-output and they've never done a system mapping so when we come and we
34:40
want to map the system and mapping the system takes two and a half months we now had a project with one of those four
34:48
networks we can't say more and they didn't understand what we're doing for
34:54
two and a half months we were just trying to understand kind of map their
35:00
system because you need to understand if you change something here it can affect things here and here and
35:06
here so you first need to map the system and the system dynamics before you can
35:12
go into the engineering part of how do I set an inflation rate of that economy etc etc so economics is a it's
35:20
very complex and it's it's quite a young science and very often has contradictory
35:27
schools and now we have these economic networks that that are in a way
Mission Critical Systems
35:36
kind of mission-critical and this is what I would like to say the problem is that at coin it was never designed and
35:44
tested in a cat-cat tool right nobody tested that system it was there was a
35:50
white paper then people came together and they created the code they deployed it maybe there was a test net in some
35:56
cases right and but then you go into main net and you have these mission
36:02
critical systems that come with thick inbuilt economic layer but we're
36:07
designing these systems like they were websites in the 1990s with the same kind of startup mentality very often kind of
36:15
quick and dirty pivot as you go along
36:22
kind of design but the problem is if you don't account for unknown unknowns if
36:27
you don't treat them as mission critical systems things happen like oops smart contract was drained 50 million
36:35
gone the Dow oops smart contract multi-sig problems 250 million gone
36:41
right so these networks it's not a website it's not Yahoo it's not a search
36:47
engine so the way we treat the development of these systems needs to be different or the engineering methods
36:54
that we use need to be a bit more use more rigorous ethics engineering ethics
37:00
in fact then what we applied in Silicon
37:06
Valley etc to build these early web sites isn't it just economics
37:12
yes but the interesting part is how well the system dynamics our economy economy
37:18
change if we can tokenize everything if I can in the future have a wallet what
37:25
which holds maybe thousands of different tokens that are fungible my Apple token for your peer token for I don't know
37:32
whatever fungible token we might enter a digital barter economy with the altered
37:39
coincidence of wants problems that analog barter economies had because we
37:46
can air swap wallet - wallet are tokens and then the question is where will
37:51
money like fiat money as the medium of exchange or any type of stable token
37:57
will there still be a need for these kind of stable tokens if you take algorithmic decentralized exchanges
38:04
paired with atomic swaps we could enter in a few years a digital barter economy that could
38:11
potentially completely change the dynamics of our current economic systems so many questions to conclude yes this
Conclusion
38:21
new token economy it's potentially a new type of value creation but the problem is we lack best practices we for the
38:29
most part we still lack modeling and forecasting tools there are many many legal uncertainties there are also
38:34
technical usability issues wallet management key management multi token
38:39
capability of wallets decentralized exchanges are not really a thing here but people are working on
38:45
atomic swaps but once we transcend all these things things will get more
38:51
interesting but one of the crash greatest challenges we still have is that we use different words to talk
38:58
about the same thing so we need clear text on amis also one of the reasons I wrote this book so if you're interested
Properties of tokens
39:04
later on you can sneak peek into the book and one of the things we did to
39:12
finish this now this is something you will find in the book it's just you this kind of table
39:18
where we talk about the technical the properties they're talking can take and when we presented this beginning of this
39:26
year at the university all the researchers were like big eyes and they were very interested and they thought it
39:32
was eye-opening and it's just the table so and for us it was quite obvious to
39:39
write this kind of write down and classify those perspectives of rights
39:44
perspective as the property right or an SS right fungibility perspective is it identical or not identical
39:50
transferability perspective can you transfer the token or not those are design questions that you have to ask
39:57
yourself the durability perspective is very important I mean it's programmable not
40:03
money you can make it expire after a while regulatory perspective is a very
40:09
important in spective but it has had too much importance like people were
40:15
focusing too much on it another question is the incentive perspective is the token minted upon a certain behavior or
40:22
does it represent some type of known access right supply perspective what
40:27
what is the supply of this token is it fixed is it unlimited and the token flow
40:33
perspective is it linear or circular is it from source to sink or does it circulate now this is just the first
40:40
draft of how we could classify different properties of tokens but if you want to
40:46
go into token engineering into designing the governance rules of your tokens these would be the main questions you
40:52
would have to ask yourself and from that then you can derive the regulatory question of what type of token is it
40:58
right so as you can see we're at the very early stages and I have much more
41:04
to say but I'd rather give you a chance to ask questions thank you very much so
Mapping the systems
41:13
there is a mic somewhere any question
41:23
it's not really a question but I was wondering if you could give us some more details about the work you did in
41:31
mapping the systems without mentioning any companies or I know your secret sauce just thank you so umm yeah it's
41:44
hard to so what we do is that we we
41:50
identify the different actors in the system and then we identify the kind of
41:57
the value flows there are so many different graphs of what is happening like who are the actors what are the
42:03
value flows what are mechanisms and what are kind of the results of these
42:11
mechanisms to say that in a more abstract word so we're trying to map
42:16
all the dynamics of a system and usually it comes in three to four layers and
42:23
then once you've mapped the whole complex system you can then go into designing the economic engineering of
42:31
that system yeah any other question do
42:39
you think there is or will be a significant pushback against the tokenization of everything I'm surprised
42:48
to see so little pushback right I think obviously regulators and we can see that
42:54
with the Libre token right now they're very critical I mean there's always their anti money laundering
43:00
questions etc but I'm surprised I've been in the scene for four years now or five years and I'm surprised to see
43:08
how little pushback actually there is and I guess because the use case is so
43:14
obvious and we live in a capitalist society that favors return on investment
43:22
and the business case for the return on investment is so clear because it cut so many transaction cost so many
43:30
operational costs this technology right so I guess because people can see the
43:36
benefits there are very few push backs that I'm seeing you spoke about how it
43:41
could replace stable quinn's do you think they would have some push back in the future well I know I think we need
43:50
stable tokens right now are stable coins right there is a big need for stable tokens
43:55
because the way most tokens have are
44:01
fluctuating in price obviously because of demand shifts and to be able to
44:07
operate a token economy currently we need a stability of value one of the properties and I talked about this in
44:14
the book as well what is money and what are the properties and the functions of money and one of the properties is
44:19
obviously stability of value so when Bitcoin was designed the value proposition and the title of the Bitcoin
44:25
paper is peer-to-peer electronic so I think Bitcoin the Bitcoin white
44:32
paper or the implementation of the Bitcoin white paper was very successful when it comes to the peer-to-peer
44:38
character to providing a universal state layer in fact it that's really revolutionary what proof-of-work did but
44:46
what what Bitcoin failed is to provide a stability of value which would be a
44:52
prerequisite for having electronic cash and this is why we're seeing a lot of stable tokens popping up and there and I
45:01
think in a short term we will need them and one of the more interesting use cases are actually what what the IMF
45:08
calls central bank digital currencies so what neh what national central banks all
45:16
over the world are now looking into and doing is they're trying to they're
45:22
creating a digital their program derivative token a blockchain token from
45:30
that represents a unit of national currency that's very interesting because
45:35
it will eradicate private banks in the long run and they were probably in the
45:41
long run it'd be maybe more successful because they already have stability of
45:46
value most of them they will be probably the go-to stable token unless
45:53
algorithmic stable tokens become more stable than they are today so we are seeing different types of stable tokens
46:00
algorithmic stable tokens about asset-backed stable tokens backed by an asset a basket of different types of
46:07
assets and then we have central bank digital currency and I think we will need that until we have a time of atomic
46:15
swaps and multi token capable wallets we will need some kind of stable token so
46:22
there is a merit in them but maybe in the long run they might not be necessary anymore
46:27
maybe like there's really no way to predict the future at this point yeah
46:33
any other question
46:39
do you have the feeling that recently with a lot of tokenization projects more and more of them of the value of token
46:47
issuance is distributed cowards thoughts the token issuer rather than the token
46:54
holder over time so I just observed that like you know maybe a year ago a lot of
47:00
tokens I don't know why there is an influx of people maybe for the next talk
47:07
all right it's okay I've just seen like maybe a year ago a lot of tokens the way
47:12
you should like straight away and if the network grows the the the value accrues with the token older whereas nowadays
47:19
more and more tokens that you should like in in batches okay yeah I mean this
47:25
is the the question of what I said here like when you design your token one of the most important questions is the
47:31
supplied perspective how many tokens do you supply and when right and most early
47:37
token sales were conducted for the purpose of just issuing a token for
47:42
fundraising purposes and the people very often didn't have sophisticated economic design behind it so yes we're seeing
47:48
that shift in kind of the economic design from a supply perspective but
47:54
people are still so I think people are more and more learning that it's not you don't issue tokens unless they represent
48:00
a share in a company you can't issue them the same way you are issued shares
48:05
in the company because the network has different dynamics it's kind of a currency of a tribe right and people are
48:12
so so we don't have good token economics yet inbuilt in most of the token designs
48:20
are very very bad token designs so it was they'll take a few years until we
48:26
fully enter a more mature token economy we're in the very early stages where
48:31
websites like in the early 90s were still bad usability and unclear
48:40
information etc yeah okay I think we might need to stop because there are so
48:46
many people coming in and I think they're coming in do we have time No okay so if you have questions we'll
48:53
go outside there is the next speaker coming and you can ask me the questions outside thank you


What is Tokenomics Explained | Tokenomics 101: Everything You Need To Know
(source: https://youtu.be/38CQ6l5bxEI?si=29jc1uaFVjx_59OB)



Introduction
0:00
welcome to whiteboard programming where we simplify  programming with easy to understand whiteboard videos  
0:04
and today i'll be sharing with you what is  tokenomics so let's get started first off  
What is Tokenomics Explained
0:13
what is tokenomics well tokenomics consists of  two words token and economics and is also called  
0:20
as cryptoeconomics it is defined as the quality of  a token which will convince a user or an investor  
0:26
to adopt it and helps in building the ecosystem  around the underlying project of that token but  
0:33
you must be wondering now hey what do you mean  by quality well to put it simply anything which  
0:38
impacts the token's value is a part of tokenomics  and you can say that tokenomics is a pretty broad  
0:44
subject and includes a variety of components  and the primary one to consider is that how the  
0:49
nature of such commercial differs from traditional  industrial economies as its characteristics are  
0:55
decentralized, require very little capital to scale  and offer significant security of transactions  
1:03
but hey what is a token well in real life a token  is a thing which serves as a visible or tangible  
1:09
representation of a fact, quality, or feeling to  be more clear you can even say that you're having  
What is Token in Blockchain
1:14
empty pocket right now and you will still stumble  across real life tokens for example your gym  
1:20
membership card is a token that represents the  fact that you have subscribed to a gym  
1:24
your driving license is a token which represents  the fact that you have taken training required  
1:29
to drive in your country your hotel key card  shows that you have paid the hotel for your room  
1:35
similarly in cryptoverse a token  is a representation of something  
1:38
in its particular ecosystem it could be value,  stake, voting right, or anything and just note that  
1:45
a token is not limited to one specific role and  can fulfill a lot of roles in its native ecosystem  
1:52
and furthermore broadly you can say that a token  represents an asset or utility that a company has  
1:59
and they will usually give it away to  their investors during a public sale  
2:05
next let's have a quick comparison  between tokens versus cryptocurrencies  
Token vs Cryptocurrency Explained
2:09
well the biggest difference between the two is  that cryptocurrencies have their own blockchains  
2:14
whereas crypto tokens are built on an existing  blockchain also do note that cryptocurrencies  
2:20
are built keeping in mind the monetary benefit  whereas many tokens are created without the intent  
2:26
to represent money or monetary value at all moving  further it's time to discuss the types of token we  
Types of Crypto Tokens
2:33
can use to best suit our possible requirements for  this we need to understand several categories into  
Layer 1 vs Layer 2 Token
2:39
which we can differentiate the tokens and as it's  pretty vast topic I'll only be mentioning a few  
2:46
important ones in this video number one layer 1 vs layer 2 here layer one is the underlying  
2:52
or the main blockchain that is the token which  powers this blockchain is the layer one token  
2:58
and layer two is the decentralized app or  ICO built on top of the underlying blockchain  
3:04
confused? let's take an example to better  understand it Omisego is a project that is  
3:09
built on top of ethereum blockchain in this case  ethereum is layer 1 and is powered by the ether  
3:14
the layer 1 token and Omisego is layer 2 and  is powered by omg that is the layer 2 token  
3:21
here you'll notice that the well-being of layer 2  application is completely dependent on the overall  
3:26
the well-being of layer 1. if there are some  issues with the layer 1 blockchain that is  
3:31
for example a hack or a bug it's going to  affect the overall well-being of layer 2 as well  
3:37
while there are many projects that are  working on making layer 1 and layer 2 as  
3:41
independent as possible but if you yourself  think on a more practical level it would be a  
3:45
lie to suggest that these two have no connection  whatsoever now if a layer 2 application is doing  
3:51
well then it reflects positively on layer 1 as  well as such many layer 1 projects try their  
3:56
best to attract as many developers as possible  to their platform so as a conclusion we can say  
4:02
that higher the quality of layer 2 application  better will be the value of layer 1 network
Original Chain vs Forked Chain | Blockchain Forking
4:09
number 2 original chain vs forked chain  this second category is mostly about layer 1
4:14
protocols which is to differentiate  whether the protocol is original or  
4:18
has it been forked off some  other protocol for example  
4:22
bitcoin and ethereum are examples of original  protocols while zcash, bitcoin cash, and litecoin  
4:28
are all examples of forked chain since they have  been forked from the main bitcoin protocol  
4:33
i'll recommend you to watch my video on blockchain  forking to better understand this concept the link for  
4:38
the same is given in the description below next  number three utility vs security token because most  
Utility vs Security Token
4:46
of the ICOs are investment opportunities in the  company itself most tokens qualify as securities  
4:52
however if the token doesn't qualify as a Howey test then it is classified as a utility token  
4:59
these tokens simply provide users with a product  and/or a service and you can more of think of  
5:05
them like a gateway token to state broadly  utility tokens have the following properties  
5:11
number one they give holders a right to use the  network number two they give the holders the  
5:16
right to take advantage of the network by voting  number three since there is an upper cap on the  
5:22
maximum token availability the value of the tokens  may go up because of the supply demand equation  
5:29
on the other hand a crypto token that passes the  Howey test is deemed to be a security token these  
5:36
usually derive their value from an external  tradable asset and because of these tokens are  
5:41
deemed as a security they're subjected to federal  securities and regulations and lastly do note that  
5:47
if the ICO doesn't follow the regulations  then they could be subjected to penalties  
5:54
number four fungible vs non-fungible  to state tokens may be fungible that is  
Fungible vs Non fungible Token
5:59
they can have interchangeability of units of a  commodity with other units of the same commodity  
6:04
like bitcoin or ethereum or non-fungible which  on the other hand are unique and thus cannot  
6:10
be interchanged ID cards or Gym membership  cards are examples of non-fungible tokens  
6:16
further you must understand that  tokenomics is evolving with innovation  
6:20
in tokens and thus there is a growing number  of tokens with more refined properties  
6:25
these tokens apart from the classification we just  discussed can be based on the following factors  
6:31
number one rights where tokens may give the holder  property rights or give the holder access rights  
6:37
number two durability wherein tokens can  remain stable in the face of censorship  
6:42
or attacks number three regulatory wherein tokens are easy to classify and regulate  
6:47
number four purpose wherein tokens are created  to serve as a proof of behavior or value creation  
6:54
or to represent existing asset or access right  number five supply wherein we offer a fixed supply  
7:01
of token or sometimes unlimited number six token  flow wherein tokens can be generated linearly  
7:09
and destroyed after use or remain in circulation  last but not the least temporal wherein tokens may  
7:15
or may not have an expiration date next let's  discuss about what makes tokenomics different  
What makes Crypto Tokenomics So Different
7:22
having briefly understood what tokenomics is let's  now explore why it is fundamentally different from  
7:26
the economics we generally operate in in the  modern economy economic forces that govern our  
7:32
lives have over time become increasingly channeled  by a few centralized bureaucratic institutions  
7:38
with the access of internet and distributed ledger the  sources of various kinds including financial  
7:44
capital, supply chain, information etc are now  flowing through these informational networks  
7:49
and quite similarly development in blockchain  provides secure and reliable way to model token  
7:54
economies to reflect better markets and serve as  underlying logic in the face of new technologies  
8:01
some of the applications of token economics are as  follows number one it offers full cost accounting  
Applications of Token Economics Explained
8:08
wherein tokens can be coded to reflect both  economic and social cost while accounting for  
8:13
example one can code into price of diamond that  are sourced ethically versus the ones that are not  
8:20
number two there's better alignment of producer  and consumer with token based economies one can  
8:25
bypass big enterprises that may not align with  consumers value this can be done by replacing  
8:31
organizations with token-based blockchain  networks wherein producers and consumers  
8:35
can find each other for their specific needs and  bypass a bigger platform this primarily replaces  
8:41
the big businesses with community-based  solutions and due to such a solution  
8:45
as the network scales the profits don't get sucked  by big centralized management but are instead  
8:50
distributed throughout the network's token holders  number three they offer triple entry accounting  
8:57
those who don't know about this it is a method of  proposed enhancement of double entry bookkeeping  
9:03
by simply cryptographically sealing all  entries dealing with an outside party with  
9:08
a third entity in the system this third entity  is the blockchain where these entries are posted  
9:14
as both receipts and transactions this if used  well easily replaces the administrative cost  
9:21
of auditing complex organizations number four  incentive systems with tokenomics built on  
9:28
blockchain protocols tokenization will become  a reward for an increasing area of transactions  
9:34
that is every source of value can be tokenized  to build microeconomics that aligns individuals  
9:39
incentive with the goal of growth of the ecosystem  further let's talk about investment and tokenomics  
Investor's Take on Tokenomics Crypto
9:46
now with a great number of projects funding  themselves using ICOs it has become important  
9:50
for investors to develop tools to analyze the  viability of their investment opportunities  
9:56
and as an investor here are the factors that you  may consider in assessing a token project as well  
10:02
first the team you must check the credentials and  reliability of the team that is behind the project  
10:07
next business model how robust is the business  model they are offering as the complexity of  
10:12
token scales from simple payment mechanisms  to the greater ones next PR and branding  
10:18
how well the project is being mobilized to the  community because in the end community matters  
10:23
next legality now legality around tokens still  remain in the dark in many jurisdictions and  
10:29
thus projects need a good legal team to make sure  that the project stands good on the legal grounds  
10:35
next token structure this is very important  and you must understand the technical aspect  
10:40
of the nature of the token which  is being developed or distributed  
Conclusion
10:45
lastly to conclude we can say that tokenomics as  a field is still in it's infancy and considering  
10:50
that it changes a lot of foundation cornerstones  of the current world economy there's a lot to be  
10:55
explored along with a wider option of tokens many  organizations are developing more complex and  
11:01
specific use cases every day with that I hope  this video was helpful to you and serve value

Token Bonding Curves Demystified: Introduction to Real-World Applications
(source: https://youtu.be/DPNkqRDQUCs?si=B1JGzDHem7hPZRc1)


Welcome by Moritz Kaminski and Jonathan Gabler
0:00
hello everybody good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you are
0:05
we have quite a international audience today so you're happy to welcome you to
0:12
the second meetup of the Swiss chapter of the global token engineering community thanks a lot for joining today
0:21
please note that this online meetup is recorded and yeah my name is Maurice
0:27
Kaminski and together with unit on table we are running the Swiss chapter of the
0:33
global token engineering community after our launch event in in in February where
0:41
we introduced basically the practice of token engineering as an emerging
0:47
professional crypto economic system design and in today's event we will
0:53
explore one of or one of very interesting primitive and namely token
0:58
bonding curse why we see burning curse basically as a yeah interesting role in
1:07
in shaping the token economics for giving crypto ecosystem with many
1:13
projects like games and also depth spiking in popularity recently before
1:19
becoming just a one-hit wonder it is important for a project team to turn a positive launch into a long-term success
1:28
given the right incentives to also participants and that they can use the
1:34
reliability of a bonding curve to continue supporting communities and
1:40
ecosystems and games beyond their first interaction and to give you a good
1:48
situational awareness about this building block we managed to put
1:53
together quite a great lineup today and with this set now would like to end over
2:00
now to jonathan who will be the moderator of today's meeting and also
2:08
guide you through the agenda now sure thanks for its yeah let me know if
2:15
you can hear me well and and see me so it's it's great to see everybody and I
2:20
have great news to announce so this will be if everybody shows up to register it will be the biggest token engineering
2:27
Meetup two days which is quite exciting and it really shows that talking engineering is
2:33
gaining traction people are becoming aware of that as an industry or a discipline forming that that's here to
2:39
stay and that takes building these systems very seriously and I also think it's it really shows the great work that
2:45
Angela for example and many other people have done in this community I think many of us who are in this community can say
2:52
that it's really community where there's lots of people contributing very practically and now we kind of seem
2:58
seeing the fruits of all of this so this is the second the second meetup that
3:03
we're doing at EE Switzerland and we're really trying to at talking engineering Switzerland we're trying to carry the
3:09
sort of the spirit of the global movement into Switzerland because there's a there's a large community here
3:15
but we think there's a bit of a vacuum when it comes to token engineering and the ante and the practice of token
3:21
engineering but we also want to really create impactful events and what that
3:27
means is we really try and do events for the audience we try and like think about like when when when will the audience go
3:35
away from an event and say I really learned something today and what we tried to do in this particular meetup is
3:41
really to put together as more it said a lineup of of different people that in
3:46
aggregate I think will provide a very nice sort of sophisticated situational awareness of what's up with bonding cars
3:53
and there's really a lot of dynamic when it comes to burning curse especially in
3:58
2020 I don't know some of you might have seen I put together a bit of a timeline it's very much not complete and not kind
4:06
of meant authoritative but like really a kind of research documenting my research and you can really see there's lots of
4:13
adoption just in recent month is lots of projects coming up following I think a
4:19
lot of great thought leadership and a lot of it we a lot of the people involved behalf here in the call today
4:24
so I wanted to quickly and see if there were share my screen and walk through the agenda please let me know in case that
4:36
does not work some Jang West right now
4:42
ok you should see my screen so we're going to start off with a little bit of historical content context with Simon I
4:50
think it's it's always helpful to understand the present and to understand where we are you know understand where
4:57
we came from and I think assignments been there from the from the very start and will provide a great context and
5:04
perspective on how this idea developed over time of of how basically this you know the process of knowledge making
5:10
around the idea of talking banneker's evolved over time then we we thought it would be good to kind of create a
5:15
baseline for beginners because not everybody in this call will be an expert
5:21
and we wanted to create an opportunity for people who are not experts but beginners to kind of still kind of jump
5:26
jump in and and understand the rest of the event better through this introduction and then we have a sort of
5:33
a battery with three case studies and three design archetypes molecule and and
5:40
call will handle both in one session and after what we we split the design
5:45
architect to talk in bonding craft design archetype talks from their application because we thought that
5:51
might kind of be beneficial to people to develop an understanding of which kind
5:56
of patterns of talking designs and features specific use cases and maybe that kind of sparks thoughts for you
6:04
know for future application era and then at the end we're going to round it off with the perspective from dr. Michaels
6:11
arugam who's going to speak about how how scientific research looks at talking
6:19
bond occurs because one thing and I've been looking a bit into their history of research recently what you see is that
6:25
there's really different perspectives on a specific subject and and scientific
6:31
research looks at a thing that we call talking bond occurs really as an epistemic object and tries to understand
6:38
the patterns and tries to abstract and really try to understand that the underlying structure of that epistemic
6:46
object and I think it's it kind of complements the very implementation focused sessions before very very nicely
6:53
so this is what we've planned I hope your you're as excited as we are so let's get
6:59
started one other thing this is talking engineering Switzerland the Swiss they're quite obsessed with time so we
7:04
want to be culturally sensitive we want to try and run it as scheduled so we've asked we've asked the the speakers to be
7:12
to be on time you can ask questions you can ask questions by submitting them to me or to Moritz and you see if you go to
7:19
the participants you see a host in brackets and if you submit your questions there I'm gonna ask them to
7:26
the speakers after their sessions and we only have time for one or two questions per speaker so this will be a bit of a
7:31
compromise in this event because we have so much content so try and ask questions which are as relevant as possible for
7:38
everybody and that increases the chances that they're going to be selected and answered and with that having said
7:46
having said that I think we should get started with the first speaker which is Simon
History and Intent of Token Bonding Curves, Simon De La Rouviere
7:52
Delarue here I do not think for many year and he really needs an introduction because he's a very well-known figure in
7:59
this space but he's doing so much and also having read a lot of your article Simon it's quite impressive what you're
8:06
pulling off there and at various ends your creator you're an artist your technologist you co.design 320 standard
8:12
and many regard you as the inventor of token bonding curves and we're very
8:17
excited to have you today and look forward to your chat to your talk thank
8:25
you I just meeting neighbors King staring okay maybe this okay screen should be
8:34
fun and yeah that should be working fine I assume it's perfect cool
8:43
okay so for this kind of talk I just wanted to give him kind of a background
8:48
to you know like what kind of steps led me to design bonding curves initially at
8:55
least from my perspective and to show you know steps of evolution that
9:01
happened to bring it to where it is today or at least where was originally created so
9:09
when I look at something like this I just want to move this bar in my way
9:19
there we go so the question I wanted to ask when I looked at blockchain
9:26
technology in its earlier days is I saw this possibility for us to create
9:31
technology tools that can reduce the cost to organize through the automation
9:38
of various protocols and the I use the word protocols here to indicate sort of
9:44
technical protocols you know it's like how do we update information and also
9:49
social protocols like how do we enter other we interact and what do we use to interact so it showed immense promise in
9:57
that capacity to allow us to coordinate globally in new manner by having this sort of database that is collectively
10:04
shared and updated in this a simultaneous manner
10:10
and so under that umbrella of the reduction of cuts I also look at the
10:16
economist Ronald Coase his theory of the firm which talks about the reason why
10:21
firms or organizations exist is because they reduce the transaction costs to
10:27
coordinate around a shared goal you know we we start an organization with the
10:34
beliefs that we want to achieve something and an organization work better than what exists in the open
10:41
market because the people inside it don't have to incur specific kind of
10:47
costs whether it's like mental resource costs social costs to achieve something
10:54
and that's why firms exist at least kosis theory to why firms exist and
10:59
everything is not just a completely open free market and I want to specifically
11:05
look at one component and this is how I got and how I proceeded we're looking at
11:10
stuff is and this actually comes from my Master's research that I did I wrote a thesis on information overload and how
11:18
we process information in an online context so I looked at the reduction of
11:25
costs from basically two perspectives it's specifically social transaction cut is we can reduce the cost cost to
11:33
coordinate by essentially boosting positive communications and on the other
11:39
side injuring negative communication so one way to put it is you know when you
11:44
have positive or novel communication you do more with less this is simple to
11:52
understand you know it's not it's not verbose or lengthy that is the words
11:57
incorrect it should be negative comes more comments but the negative communication is when things happen
12:05
where you say less with more and the best example of this that we're all familiar with is that right you want to
12:11
reduce spam as communication in organization because it adds to the
12:17
transaction cost to coordinate from there one of the things that
12:25
they're meant they're different ways to achieve this to like boost the good signals and endure the negative signals
12:32
and one of the ways in which I looked at was simply to add some economic costs to
12:38
communication this is one form of sort of execution or implementation to achieving this goal and a simple example
12:45
of this is you know when bandwidth is low you know no one is talking or sharing valuable information
12:51
you kind of want to incentivize people to communicate you know when there's a vacuum of communication it's like we
12:58
need something to happen but the right people aren't talking to the right people or she's not sharing to the right
13:04
channels literally either incentivizing to do so or in a blocking context which
13:10
literally can we just pay people to communicate when the bandwidth is low on the other side when the bandwidth is
13:18
high you know when when it's too much chatter happening too much communication too much noise we kind of want to incur some kind of
13:26
economic cost to to communication such that when we do communicate it is a very
13:34
high signal so you switched around to saying people pay to communicate when the balance is high to reduce spam there
13:43
are another way that we are much more familiar with that reduce assertion
13:49
transaction cut and that is the concept or of ownership or equity and this we
13:55
see in modern corporations and firms form all over the world and to stand to
14:00
another extent we see ownership over platforms networks with blockchain
14:06
technology through tokens and cryptocurrencies so the value of equity
14:13
in reducing social transaction cost is that allows you to increase leverage when you organize so one way to think
14:21
about it is if I want to see something happen in the world forming an organization with other people allows us
14:29
to work together to make this happen but the value of equity in
14:35
context is that it gives us an additional incentive of bonus question if we achieve our goals we maximize the
14:43
value that's being produced we all share in in the company and the goal that's
14:48
being achieved so equity increases organizing in novel contexts so I used
14:54
the term reload bandwidth environment which is officially new industries like there's always this concept of like a
15:00
gold rush when new technology is invented when people are trying to use
15:05
it to invent new things and then you know investors with money in there and like young engineers go there and try to
15:12
figure things out so equity in some sense is the execution of this idea
15:18
where tries to seek novelty and on the other side of the spectrum which is in high bandwidth environments economic
15:25
environments we where you have for example have an established industry the
15:31
existence of equity can sometimes like overly incentivize people that brings a
15:38
force negative effects in the market things like cartel behaviour anti-competitive things monopolies or
15:44
the godless and so forth so it's largely these two concepts that I saw that was
15:50
something that we could potentially use to allow us to coordinate in a new
15:56
fashion across wherever you are in the world and using blockchain to do so and
16:01
from those two concepts I started thinking a lot about this and trying to figure out what are the sort
16:08
of ideas out there that we can use that allows us to coordinate but also create
16:15
wealth together and so I started writing a lot talking to a lot of people and
16:21
sharing these ideas in the beginning there wasn't many people around that
16:27
were as excited about these ideas but there were at least a handful of people that that that I shared some of these
16:33
ideas with such as much a Penske and and made her from epicenter and so we shared
16:40
a bunch of these ideas around and it took on different forms over time and I wrote a bunch this I call the different
16:47
things like hashtag markets me atención market attention bonds content
16:52
producing dowels all these things try to work together to solve two problems
16:58
he reduce the cost to communicate loose novel signals but also at the end like
17:04
creates a need together and a big portion of that was actually and this is where some people might always find a
17:11
strangers like much of these ideas came from seeing dogecoin succeed as a prince
17:16
as something that exists you know it was a cryptocurrency that had no technical
17:22
innovation it innovated through what it represented and I would seem to credibly
17:27
powerful as an idea um could we recreate those coins for many different
17:32
communities where the community can create well together while simultaneously communicating in a new
17:40
manner and so over time I worked in these ideas the hashtag market for
17:47
example was very close to what the bonding curve was or like eventually
17:53
what a morning surf became it was a tool where you would you would buy a coupon
18:00
would say ether in the same manner where to monotonically deterministically increasing supply but the price would
18:08
only decrease if the coupon is dispensed for some activity in the network so
18:13
where as a bonding curve which is you can just sell back in at any point in time so it was very similar which is
18:20
some input happened that allowed us to congregate around a shared goal and once
18:25
we use this new coupon for services producing the network with the price
18:31
goes down so it's sort of the feedback loop that I wanted to see happen and then around 2017 the first iteration of
18:41
token bonding curves I designed that I wrote down and it was essentially again
18:47
I could describe the concept of there being equity in a community that could allow them to curate information
18:54
together collapse on form automation of protocol and that's the bonding curve and in the article it is described
19:02
exactly as today with ether you buy some community token that stays in the reserve you use
19:08
this token to stake on information that you deem meaningful in the community and to literally put your money where your
19:15
mouth is and at any point in time you can decide to sell it back into the
19:21
curve take some reserve out and then you can accept easily there's always liquidity and my belief
19:27
was this this simple mechanism is meaningful because you essentially
19:33
undergo some kind of opportunity cost by locking up some valuable funds and then
19:39
signaling it to your community or group that's where I my direction of bond
19:45
occurs get from I wanted to see and create a curation community and you know
19:50
two tutors there I wouldn't say there's been something that looked like this that exists in a scale in the hwachun
19:57
space probably the closest something like steam it but otherwise things like
20:03
meme factory is probably close to that otherwise Bonnie curves have primarily
20:09
been used as sort of community fundraising or some kind of fundraising tools for specific goals rather than it
20:16
being used as a signalling signaling tool but I hope that time will come
20:22
so to also add this for historical
20:27
accuracy I did write an article on this which is you know like who invented
20:33
token bonding curves and to my surprise I only later discovered that it was
20:39
actually a simultaneous invention bank or was invented in the summer of 2016
20:44
and they first announced it in February 2017 and they came from a different
20:50
angle a slightly different angle but also tried to solve the problem of the
20:56
long tail of tokens you know we needed to be able to build methods of exchange
21:01
but we're from my case I wanted to see communities work amongst themselves but
21:07
on bankers case it was like yes there will be many kinds of tokens not
21:14
necessary for communities but we just want to both form of exchange that allows there to always be the kind of liquidity that
21:20
doesn't work with a border book and I
21:25
was really great I think it I think it also says them and to our inaction generally happens sometimes you know
21:31
it's like things happen from different angles and different perspectives and I'm I love what the banqueting is done
21:38
and I've contributed to this state so you know kudos to to to them
21:43
so the I might be running a bit quickly but I hopefully that gives people plans
21:49
on asking questions but the the historical context as you can see is
21:55
like it was a set of evolutionary steps where the goal was for me to design
22:01
something where you can have it so genius circuit model that allows communities to generate both together
22:06
but also then solve coordination problems through this method you know it's like what if we could automate an
22:13
organization for the modern age the modern information age I think in the
22:19
hash tag markets article or even mentioned like what if we what if we put tokens into read it and I would see like
22:25
today we know read it if experimenting with tokens they just obviously haven't yet tied tokens to information curation
22:34
now before I talk about the intention i think as i additionally from additional
22:39
time the the the thing about the intent
22:44
the thing about which which i think is book difficult problem to solve which is an open-ended question mark is the
22:55
a lot of these ideas talk about adding in current economic cost to to adding
23:01
some kind of economic value and cost to information sharing and I think that can
23:06
sometimes obscure or cannibalize other incentives you know incentives like altruistic sharing or incentives for
23:13
personal reasons like we I use Twitter because I like reading but also like sharing people do Wikipedia because they
23:20
want to enjoy the art of directing and editing and making a global encyclopedia
23:29
and if we only have economic signals we can there's this possibility that you
23:34
overcrowd the other incentives especially with something like information curation so what you can end
23:40
up at is something where users serve the protocol and not the protocol serving
23:45
the users I think that's the opening question now the final part that I want
23:51
to touch upon before you get to questions is why I think this film matters because the the reason why I got
23:59
into the space and sort of thinking about all these ideas have always been at the base point which is these are
24:05
tools that we can use to empower people to give people agency and to give people access when their own societies don't
24:12
necessarily give it to them you know whether it's whether you don't have access to financial means to economic
24:19
means to legal means or you're in a failed state or a state that stops you
24:25
from being able to do things you know I first got excited about this coin because I grew up in a country at the
24:32
tip of Africa that didn't have access to pay stall until you know late tooted
24:38
lace-like early playing they say 2010 you know it's like I didn't have access to financial infrastructure the same way
24:45
that the first world this and that's though I think what we need to keep in mind and that's why I'm really grateful that there are a lot of
24:51
people here like 74 people in this coal that are as excited about this stuff as I am you know so so thank you - Jonathan
24:59
- Moritz for organizing this and thank you to everyone listening and and I look
25:04
forward to all the amazing talks but then for Jeff gross Rudy Sean and Michael so they just keep that in mind if you
25:11
keep in mind why we're here we want to give our good to people thank you Thank You Simon
25:17
that was awesome we have we have a question here in the chat and I also have one or two semi asked thoughts on
25:24
future on the future of refundable tokens NFC micro ownership so a
25:31
refundable token for those who aren't familiar if if you tokenize ownership
25:37
over a non fungible token so you allow people to buy in into ownership with a
25:43
bonding curve of say a piece of art or another phone collectible I think it's a
25:51
I think it's a cool idea but I think the context matters a lot because if you NFC
25:58
the value of n of T is the ability to also transfer it right to the ability to talk to to give it to someone else or to
26:05
buy it and sell to someone else if you so kanai's ownership over it then you by
26:12
virtue of making ownership fungible in it you you do slow down its ability to
26:19
transfer like sometimes you would have maybe that in order to transfer it all the participants need to agree to
26:26
transfer it for example so I would like to see people do more stuff with it I
26:33
still think it's a cool idea but I think the context matters okay that's a
26:38
meaningful okay awesome I have a question I want to throw in and
26:43
you touched on it in your in your talk but I think there's still a bit of an uncertainty around the definition of tow
26:48
component curves and at some point you had a bit about Twitter it's with a discussion on what is it and what is not
26:54
maybe that's not the entity to I think yeah I think is the case when you're
27:01
working with some with something to you naming it's always a hard problem and I didn't come up with the name Bonnie
27:07
anchors it was the Zack dot-org team that looked at what I wrote on curation
27:13
markets and said this thing inside the curation market this continuous token model let's call this a Bonnie curve I
27:20
was looking for a name for it that's the component and then they came up with a name I like this describes it really
27:26
well but obviously it's still confusing today because it's only meaningful so I've seen it so can engineering
27:32
community or blockchain community and people outside I have no idea what you mean when you say the word bonding curve
27:38
and even inside our community people might use the word to denote all kinds
27:44
of automated market makers and I think that's where I felt sometimes
27:50
uncomfortable when people said you need swap is a bonding curve because I didn't want to take credit for that when I know
27:56
the way I design it in my head is that uni swap doesn't use bonding curves
28:01
right it's just another form of automated market-maker so to finalize that question to me a
28:08
bonding curve is and I think been whittled biggest benefit going to cover this in his talk but do you need a
28:14
bonding curve is you have a the primary
28:19
focus on a bond group is this concept of a token supply growing and shrinking based on there being a reserves attached
28:25
to it so if you have one token you put it in amongst new tokens as part of its
28:32
process whereas other automated market makers might merely serve as an exchange
28:38
and it would look like something like a Monica but it but it doesn't have the
28:43
component where you're minting me a token I think that's still sort of the core things that I think is important
28:49
that it's actually the bond equipment we need token perfect thank you so that was
28:56
already all the time we had thank you so much for coming on sign okay next next question is sorry no I'm just I'm happy
29:03
that it worked out perfectly and it's worth matter yeah that was Leila's own on point so your sessions next I wanna
Technical Introduction for Beginners, Benjamin Scholtz
29:13
quickly did you spend so I at some point because I'm learning coding I asked then
29:19
what kind of coding programming languages he speaks and then he came up with a list of I don't know how many likes which is this oh so then not only
29:26
is a rockstar coder he's a cat-cat contributor very advanced CAD coder he's originally a mechatronics
29:34
engineer has a background in bio-inspired robotics and control controls
29:39
engineering all of that good stuff that's very helpful for talking engineering and he's gonna give an
29:44
introduction on that's a bit more beginners focused and I want to just
29:50
before we start put one thing out that we want to show our faces in this community and also not only between each
29:56
other but also to the outside world so I'd love if everybody could just like switch on his or her camera and then we
30:04
can take a group picture as well just want to throw this out there go ahead then thanks Jonathan
30:11
can you see my presentation yeah great okay
30:18
I'm going to be giving a technical introduction to bonding curbs specifically for beginners and this is
30:25
to give you the basic overview of the ticket of the landscape of Bonny curves and a few of the goals that I'd like to
30:32
achieve with this is that by the end of this you'll be able to speak to your friends about burning curbs you
30:37
understand a bit of the lingo that's involved you'll get an idea of how our binding curves have evolved and been
30:42
extended upon and also gain confidence generally in token engineering and being
30:49
able to explore the space a little bit deeper learning curves are a very core
30:55
component of a lot of token engineering systems and some of the basic properties of that you've learnt a bit about
31:02
already from Simon are that you've got a function which is at its most at least a
31:08
function of token price and supply it is monotonic which means it's always increasing and it is also predictable
31:17
deterministic so given the same input here we have the same output but as you'll you'll see in later examples
31:23
there are lots of variations of this and this is all where it all started so you could consider this a monotonic Bonnie
31:30
curve so there are a lot of misconceptions about bounding curves
31:36
mainly because of the sort of applications that they've been used for so as you saw you know the creation
31:43
markets as well as automated market makers being developed alongside each other a lot of people
31:48
because of the use of bonding codes for funding or exchanges or various other
31:54
funding mechanisms people think that Ponzi schemes Yunis swap has also been sort of talked
32:01
about as a banning curve and it's kind of bonding curve so you'll see some of those properties that it differs later
32:09
and I just like to give you a little bit of a background on a few simple sort of
32:16
block chain or crypto economic concepts that might help understand what I'm
32:21
going to talk about now so finding curves with the introduction of Bitcoin
32:27
I mean blockchain with the introduction of Bitcoin introduced the idea of scarcity and the digital domain so a
32:34
classic example of this is having an apple you know it's unique it's in the real world if you take a picture of that
32:40
Apple and you then put it in the digital domain it is no longer guaranteed that
32:47
that is unique it can be copied shared spread and blockchain introduced
32:52
mechanism to solve this double spending problem of being able to use a token or
32:58
something of value more than once liquidity this is a sort of nice way to
33:06
visualize it in the in the case of the exchange you've got willing buyers and willing sellers and this introduces the idea of
33:15
liquidity so liquidity is the availability of liquid assets for transaction and trade and bonding curves
33:24
can be used to introduce liquidity for systems and here's a concept called
33:32
price discovery which is I think microeconomics which is the way demand
33:38
and supply interact with each other and reach an equilibrium point where for
33:44
pricing of some commodity and money
33:51
curves have been used and can be used as a primitive price discovery mechanism I
33:56
think this is probably most prominent in that in curation markets
34:02
okay so basic terminology or lingo some of these are concepts that are not only
34:10
for money curves or would also token engineering the idea of collateral and reserve so collateral is the value that
34:17
is provided in exchange for a supply of tokens and the reserve is the pool of
34:23
value back in the token supply so in this chart here you can see a basic
34:28
curve this isn't necessarily a bonding curve but underneath you can see the area of under the curve which would be a
34:36
sort of integration by parts or and the screen area represents the collateral
34:43
that is backed by the bonding curve so the tokens that are supplied along the
34:50
x-axis would have a collateral backing being the area under the curve the idea
34:58
of market cap or market capitalization is something from the sort of financial world it's not nothing new but in the
35:05
case of bonding curve it would be the spot price multiplied by your total token supply and your supply is the
35:14
tokens issued in exchange for your reserve collateral so I'm gonna try attempt to draw I think it doesn't seem
35:30
to let me forget a bonding curve function this is your function that
35:36
describes the relationship between your token price and your token supply the
35:43
spot price is the value of a single token at a point along a curve so in this this diagram here you can see the
35:50
current price and where if you were to buy a supply of ten tokens you would pay
35:59
you would exchange that for value in collateral which would be the
36:05
highlighted area under the curve
36:10
so this is not something I'm gonna dive too deep in into but there are a number
36:16
of formulae and properties of binding curves that's a sort of common
36:23
properties between a number of different implementations of binding curves and one of them is the reserve ratio and
36:30
this is the ratio between the reserve or the area under the curve to the market
36:36
cap where the market cap is a sort of
36:41
yeah it's the value of your total so can supply x the spot price and here you can
36:48
see how varying a parameter such as your reserve ratio can have an effect on the
36:55
resulting Pauling curve the idea of
37:01
slippage and price sensitivity this would be the effect of a token transaction on the spot price and I
37:08
think all you need to know here is that the reserve ratio and the inverse leverage ratio both of these properties
37:16
affect how sensitive your your pricing mechanism is to trading and transactions
37:23
and you can if you were to go and use you know swap you would be given a percentage which really indicates what
37:29
slippage you would get from transacting a number of the mechanisms and automated
37:38
market makers and bonding curves have the idea of an invariant this is
37:43
basically it's a property or relationship that remains constant if you did basic geometry triangles have a
37:50
number of a different invariants and the same holds for bonding curves in a in a
37:55
different way so what is it a market maker it's a mechanism that creates or
38:02
provides liquidity in exchange for a given token and coming up you'll see the concept of automated market makers so
38:13
when you're designing a running curve there are a number of different properties that you you have four
38:20
parameters that you can design around and they all have different effects and
38:26
it's it's almost a bit of an art I'd say so some of the parameters listed here
38:33
gonna go into a bit more detail about each one okay firstly the idea of time
38:42
so binding curves a nice analogy for them is a sort of it's a it's a pool of
38:50
collateral and over time this collateral can change it can aggregate over time so
38:59
there are a few examples coming up in the future in the later presentations about the idea of voting and how
39:06
people's conviction in a given vote can collect over time and also token vesting
39:18
pricing surprise differences basically on the left you can see bonding curve as
39:25
we saw earlier a very basic bonding curve where you've got the same price
39:31
for buying in as well as selling out if you were to introduce a different curve
39:37
for buying and selling out you could introduce the idea of taxation you could disincentivize bad behavior by having
39:45
this sort of cost for selling out of the market or binding curve you can also
39:55
decide to choose what collateral you want to be held in your burning curve so
40:01
the bonding curve collateral pool if you were to have Bitcoin in that core you
40:06
would have a very volatile markets and it wouldn't be necessarily be truly
40:11
representative of something some idea or or thing that you're trying to curate in
40:16
the case of curation markets you would probably want to rather use die which is a stable sort of US dollar
40:23
tethered or token and also got one of
40:30
the questions that came up earlier was fungible and refundable tokens
40:36
this is once again and some parameter that you would be able to to choose your
40:44
supply basically just whether it's capped or and capped so if you have a cap of 10 million tokens that would
40:53
introduce different sort of user interaction and behavior than if you had a I'm cat supply that's for market that
41:00
is intended to be very long-lived you
41:09
can choose the function of your one in curve and this is the relationship between your price and token supply you
41:16
can sort of try and design or drive different actor incentives and some of
41:21
the dynamics that you you introduced with different functions can only truly be fully understood with modeling which
41:27
is topic I'll briefly cover and I'm sure so that the black science team will dive
41:32
into a few deeper discussions around modeling of bonding curves and token systems gives a few basic funding curves
41:41
a basic linear curve quadratic curve and the Colin stack curve which I hope I got
41:50
right so you can also a token
41:57
engineering system often has sort of a
42:02
very modular make up where you could compose different bonding credits money
42:07
codes different inputs and outputs you could have different parameters for different phases of your project or
42:14
system and this is a very useful feature
42:19
of bonding curves which the common stack rented binding curve uses very well and
42:25
composing a sort of more complex system around just voting so automated market
42:32
makers and liquidity providers are their bonding curves so you know stock
42:38
bankroll and balancer all describe some form of mathematical relationship between two or more token pools their
42:47
shares some properties of bonding curves and they all have a mathematical pricing
42:52
relationship with some form of invariant
42:58
so unis wok is described as an automated liquidity provider they have a
43:03
relationship described by the function there where K is the invariant x and y
43:08
are the reserve balanced token pair and this relationship gives it certain
43:14
properties which we won't get into but it does share some of the same features
43:22
of bonding curves here you can see a basic model as modeled by Marcus's from
43:29
locking science where it's as your sort
43:36
of reserve of one or other of the other tokens whether it's in this case the
43:42
theorem will die as that reserve changes your price along this curve is adjusted
43:51
to match this relationship so bank or is
44:00
described as an oil available constant liquidity sourced it's also got a
44:05
function that describes some of its properties with an invariant in the case of Angkor this invariant is the reserve
44:12
ratio so balancers a is a sort of
44:20
portfolio manager and it's difficult to see from this image but it's it's a 3d
44:25
image and it's no longer is your sort of basic idea of a monotonically increasing
44:31
bonding curve but then introduces more sort of dimensions and has some of the
44:40
same properties so it extends it's a generalization of Eunice Fox constant
44:46
product rule and allows more two or more tokens but with arbitrary weights so if
44:52
you had a portfolio or let's it's an investment portfolio and you've got different tokens with that you want to
44:58
keep balanced within that portfolio percentages this would allow you to do
45:04
that so what are some of the limitations
45:10
of random designing Bunning codes so specifically it comes around because of solidity and the theorem virtual
45:18
machine some of the mathematics becomes a bit more complex to implement you get overflows and under flows you get
45:24
front-running you get that processing of transactions to try and avoid slippage
45:30
and here's a picture of some bonding
45:36
code Bonnie curve code for a basic linear bonding curve so this is probably the
45:44
simplest implementation you could get for a linear bonding curve and basically
45:50
all you're doing is you're implementing an integral of your bonding function and
45:56
an inverse integral of that function and this allows you to calculate both the buying and selling prices for a set
46:05
number of tokens so bonding curves when
46:11
integrated into token engineering systems become complex this is not necessarily a limitation but it is a
46:16
limitation if you do not have if you do not model your system and you do not simulate it properly and I'm sure you
46:23
all you hear more about this later so
46:31
one more the engineering practice basic engineering practice is being brought to take in engineering and this is
46:38
introduced to sort of more iterative design cycle where you have your
46:44
implementation you can then have a carbon sort of copy model of it you can
46:50
simulate the behaviour of your model and try and inform the design and implementation in the real world with
46:56
different actors with its different users or mechanisms assist other systems
47:01
that you're integrating with so why would you want to do this this allows
47:07
you to validate your designs test for how a robust your system is find edge
47:14
cases check how sensitive your system is to two small changes and some of your
47:19
parameters and find out what the bounds of your system are some case edge cases
47:27
are more more obvious than others and modeling helps to find those that are
47:32
more complex or less obvious so how is
47:38
this done you can do actor modeling and simulation CAD the card cad framework is
47:45
open source library that was built by black science and allows you to do simulation of complex systems with
47:52
there's things like parameter sweeping which is changing a parameter and seeing what effect it has on your system and
47:59
running Monte Carlo methods which allow you to run very large experiments on
48:07
your annual system for example here you
48:12
see a basic experiment with different parameters and some sort of Python data
48:19
science type outputs from it so what about in curves used to win the wild all
48:25
sorts of things which you're gonna get a whole range of examples in the later
48:30
presentations some of them are things like system interfaces voting community
48:37
currencies and funding is also part of this is probably one of the ones that have been sort of gotten most of the
48:45
attention but there's a lot going on in his face so what are the trends
48:52
application of the engineering methodology more and more degrees of freedom in your design choices more
48:59
variables are being introduced such as time and they're being used in as a
49:04
modular part of larger systems rather than simple funding mechanism just like
49:12
to thank contributions from angler for the presentation and there are a bunch
49:18
of resources the token engineering websites being the first one the CAD CAD discourse channel and this presentation
49:25
is on github with a slightly more extended version if you want to read it and you can send any
49:32
questions my way thank you thank you Ben
49:38
unfortunately for this session we don't have time for questions if there are any urgent questions please post them in the
49:44
chat now otherwise that move on to to Paul Paul you're ready to go awesome so
Case Study I: Molecule Catalyst, Paul Kohlhaas
49:56
I quickly introduced you there so you're a technology entrepreneur you've done a
50:02
whole bunch of things that you're the founder of Linum labs the founder of molecule and what I find exciting about
50:08
molecule is that you guys have actually launched a system in January called
50:13
catalysts I think what you're going to speak about today which is a protocol providing a new distributed ownership
50:19
structure for pharmaceutical compounds and yeah I think I'm both looking
50:25
forward to hear about how you went about you know your moniker of design and also like what you know how the launch went
50:31
and what are you trying to do with this project awesome
50:36
yeah Jonathan thank you so much for the invitation to speak and thanks for the kind introduction and yeah also for
50:42
organizing this I think it's really great to bring the community together on
50:48
a regular basis I think that's really important cool so as Jonathan already
50:54
said I'm the founder of molecule and linen labs which was kind of the
50:59
software development house that I had built this first implementation around molecule before yeah before I'm gonna
51:07
jump into the depth of what we did and what we launched in in January I want to say like why for us to and Monica's a
51:13
really cool use case and application in this context of what we're trying to do
51:19
with molecule our kind of broad go with molecule is really to a first attempt at
51:24
decentralizing pharmaceutical and biotech Rd specifically in the early
51:29
stages and I think if anything the current healthcare crisis that we're
51:36
witnessing is putting an enormous new pressure on finding quick and efficient ways on how we
51:42
discover medicines and new treatments and that's something essentially that we're I would stand for some very brief
51:50
background a lot of you might be aware of this but developing new pharmaceuticals has never been more slow
51:57
expensive or risky than it is today the average time to market for a drug
52:02
today is over ten years it can cost up to two and a half billion dollars in development to bring a new drug to market it has a really low chance of
52:09
success the current effort for example that we're seeing in corona virus vaccine development we're even bringing
52:16
a new vaccine to market within two years is completely unheard of but at the same time we believe that the time is right
52:22
for newer quicker development models and we think that decentralization has a
52:27
super core role to play there but because of the way the system works today drugs are getting increasingly
52:33
expensive and fewer drugs are actually coming to market and why is that the
52:39
case our thesis is that drug development is essentially where softer development was 30 years ago it's extremely
52:45
proprietary so it's all driven by patents it's very closed off very
52:51
secretive and then one of the one of the big issues that we find in the industry
52:56
today that there's a big lack in early-stage funding and when I first
53:03
started looking at this topic and I met Simon 2016 and he had these ideas around
53:09
a curation market and there's this huge similarity in curation markets and drug
53:15
development so this is essentially the very classic pharmaceutical development pipeline you have drug discovery first
53:23
you start out with basic research then you have you discover a new molecule you man that molecule into the preclinical phases then phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3
53:29
and then it comes to market and here at the bottom we have classical innovation cycles and at within companies or
53:38
externally and essentially you start with a very large funnel of new molecules and now you have to filter out
53:45
what is gonna work what works for which use case and throughout the history of drug development for example there have
53:51
been many many molecules that have been to bail later on someone else discovered that hey actually it does could be used in a
53:56
different use case and this is eerily similar to like how curation markets are
54:03
designed or how also how we curate information more broadly and I really enjoyed what just what Simon said in the
54:09
the beginning of this talk that this combination are reducing information asymmetry through the distribution of
54:16
equity to to owners because it creates new incentive and new behavior structures this is a pretty old slide
54:23
that I've used a lot but it's essentially how we could kind of then brought onto the topic this combination of one could we so drug development is
54:30
always based on IP and patents could we attach patent value to an unfunded token
54:36
and then in a second step could we use that now that on chain asset to raise liquidity around the development of of a
54:43
new drug and another really interesting element that this app is that bonding
54:49
curves as a whole can serve as these open source prediction markets so positive data increases the price of an
54:55
asset negative data decreases its price and this see and this solves one of the principal problems that you have in drug
55:01
development that there's a strong principal agent problem that if you're developing a drug you only want to release the good data and there's
55:08
something known in the sciences more broadly which is called the reproducibility crisis but for a lot of
55:13
early stage sentiment development there's no incentive to publish negative data and then if people are trying to
55:18
reproduce a specific scientific result they are they're often unable to reproduce it and we've we felt that we
55:27
felt for a very long time that morning here's kin or new automated market makers can play a key role in overcoming
55:33
some of the challenges in the industry overall just a brief recap what are we
55:39
trying to do essentially we're trying to move IP out of companies and out of universities specific universities at
55:44
the moment into an open ecosystem where drugs can be developed openly and
55:49
collaboratively so essentially it's a two-sided protocol as a true side of marketplace of drug developers and and
55:55
patients and investors this is a this is a long-term vision of what this might
56:00
look like you essentially would have a marketplace where you see rising and falling prices on different
56:06
assets that in development the research is working on them essentially really creating collaborative workspaces and
56:12
and funding environments for for these new assets so as Jonathan Fed said we
56:19
launched the first experiment using Ronnie curbs and this exact use case on
56:24
the ether Manor in January I'm really saying it was the first experiment because I think we realize going into
56:31
that that there was a lot of things that were still missing and what I really want to share with you over the next yeah the next remaining 10 10 to 15
56:39
minutes is some of the insights that we took away from that first how the system works and then also the insights and
56:44
learnings that we took away from that and kind of what what's next on our roadmap um so just a very brief recap so
56:51
what we launched is a system called molecule catalyst which in its most basic form is a Kickstarter for very
56:56
early-stage scientific research but the goal is obviously that instead of where the Kickstarter you normally either you
57:02
receive you're just doing it for the cause of it or you receive a share not a share actually use you receive the
57:09
product that comes out of it eventually in our case our goal is we need to give people ownership in the IP that they're
57:15
funding and so the way that catalyst worked is funders would make a contribution into catalyst the the
57:22
funding would be forwarded to the researcher the researcher would then contribute his research data into
57:28
catalyst and in return the funders would receive project stakes so ownership in
57:33
this new research project the first project that we kind of pioneered this
57:40
was was a high-impact clinical trial to study the effects of micro dosing psilocybin with the University of
57:47
Toronto and Toronto Centre for psychedelic science pretty fringy topic but also I think it's a it's a very cool
57:54
overlap with some of the ethos of the crypto community how it works basically
58:00
was so the fundraising mechanism itself worked by a banach curve that had a 25%
58:05
tax this means that 25% I contributed 75
58:12
died would go directly into research funding and 25 died would become a project state that essentially now
58:19
creative liquidity pool and a measure of value around this particular research project
58:24
and this is just an example how essentially the market builds up over time as more contributions come in so in
58:32
return anyone could contribute by opening there was no kyc anyone could
58:38
really kind of participate and become a co-owner in this in this research project here just a quick recap so the
58:44
token prices so it was a linear bonding curve we chose a linear bonding curve because it was one of the like the
58:50
simpler designs to really experiment with and to provide clarity also to the users we also wanted to design a system
58:58
that was reasonably fair to everyone contributing so less like one of those
59:03
extremely exponential bonding curves between a cheaper fair distribution of the time so the token price increases
59:09
linear with supply at the early contributors obviously received more tokens the token represents your stake
59:15
in the reward pool so legally speaking with this first project we couldn't attach any any property rights yet on
59:22
the one side this came from the University because they wanted all of the data that came out of this project to be open-source but it was also one of
59:29
the big problems that we encountered like if you're dealing with real-world assets like you need to engineer you
59:35
need to do the legal engineering and this contribution rate now creates an immediate funding liquidity and the
59:41
taxation mechanism that we implement it also prevents pump-and-dump behavior because it would take quite a while with
59:48
a 25 with a 75% taxation to actually yeah to get it to a break-even point
59:53
again but we felt at the time that this would also create very strong incentives for the early contributors to
59:59
essentially become what do you say that supporters or like vocalists or like
1:00:04
fanboys that would can now convince other people to start pondering again is
1:00:11
it this is kind of just a technical diagram how this works so the the contributions will go into research
1:00:16
funding or vault there's a timer that was implemented in smart context that we ran that a certain fund that a certain
1:00:23
Mouse don't have to be reached at a certain point in time and then only then the researcher could withdraw their
1:00:30
funding and if that milestone that funding milestone was not met then the accumulated research funding is
1:00:36
returned and can be exchanged again for project opens this is also similar design as Kickstarter has in that sense
1:00:42
that if you don't reach your funding goal obviously you can't start a clinical trial without the required
1:00:47
funds so if that is not reached then the funds are returned
1:00:53
we got amazing support from the community when we launched this I think it's one of the first like complex live
1:01:01
bonding curve based systems on on main net it lends itself quite well as well
1:01:07
to I think what Jeff or Griff is going are going to talk about later which are automated bonding crypt designs I think
1:01:12
this in this sense is a relatively simple first augmented bonding curve design in the world we've got hundreds
1:01:20
of unique interactions really great feedback from the community but we didn't get to our target which is
1:01:27
obviously the like the bigger goal of what we're trying to achieve so we reached about 10% of the initial target
1:01:34
which came in plus minus this is just a screenshot from the campaign which came
1:01:40
in plus minus 2 under yet just under $5,000 and in the context of what we're
1:01:48
trying to do that was a big success but we also had to realize that hey if we're trying to fund early stage drug development like this is not like we're
1:01:54
not helping the scientists like this and so we took a lot of learnings away from
1:02:00
that first yeah from that first exercise and one of the really big learnings that
1:02:06
I want to share with you oh and by the way if any of you contributed to the campaign by the way you you can withdraw
1:02:13
your stake at any time so essentially all funds as well have been like a being
1:02:19
returned to to whoever contributed to the campaign I explained partially to
1:02:29
like other people in the community but also like to ourselves like we we had a lot of internal discussion around what we would do next and this would run and
1:02:34
I think this is quite telling in terms of designing a bonding curve based system and now I'm really talking about
1:02:40
use cases I mean we can do all the like the modeling and all the token engineering that we want if
1:02:46
if your user base doesn't fundamentally over line with what you're trying to do then no cap cap model can help you with
1:02:53
that and and so this is kind of like and I mean I think we could have seen some
1:02:59
of this coming but I also always think you just need to experiment and just put yourself out there and you know that's
1:03:06
kind of that's how you that's how you move along you know and so just consider this as a Venn diagram I mean it's
1:03:11
pretty self-explanatory this is funding people that are interested in funding biotech and
1:03:16
psychedelics and then there's people interested in crypto and now within the
1:03:22
crypto community you have a portion of the crypto community that are native died users well-liked made to defy users
1:03:27
they have meta mas they have a dot they have died in their wallet you'd be surprised how many people don't even
1:03:33
have to like I'm continuously surprised and then within I'd say native dye users
1:03:38
you have an even smaller circle that are interested in bonding curves and this is kind of where we chose to launch our
1:03:45
first our first experiment and we just realized that that is a very small
1:03:51
target area and I think it's reflected well it's reflected in the campaign and
1:03:57
I think the success that we had in the campaign but yeah I think that was a
1:04:03
really good insight for us and for us I don't think we've discarded from that up from that exercise that this general
1:04:09
notion isn't going to work what I think needs to happen is these circles need to grow quite a lot in order for this whole
1:04:17
thing to come together in a better way so yeah some other insights that we had
1:04:25
I'm just gonna run through these so when dealing yet seemed seems obvious but but
1:04:31
maybe not so obvious when dealing with real world essence really focus on the legal engineering first so I think for
1:04:37
for a lot of fringy crypto s cues cases where you don't need legal engineering or where you're not dealing with the
1:04:43
real world assets go at launch like launch I had an experiment but but at the end of the day like what we are
1:04:49
trying to do is to get people we need to benefit and the upside of the potential IP that is generated if we can't
1:04:55
guarantee that it's a hard sell a second one I think that is the community around an asset prior to
1:05:01
launch or build a community around what you're trying to achieve with your moniker first and then try to launch the
1:05:07
curve internally first rather than just fully public you so growing something
1:05:13
within a community where the community can take over governance functions in our case this could have been for example I have a community of
1:05:19
researchers that helps codify an evaluation and a starting point for the Banach group rather than us as a team
1:05:25
having to kind of define these parameters and sometimes just feeling a little bit out of a depth don't
1:05:31
underestimate the marketing efforts required to get a bonding curve active and liquid it's an enormous amount of
1:05:37
marketing it's like it weights its crowdfunding essence or like in many in many cases and and we as a team we had
1:05:44
to realize that if we're gonna spend 60 70 percent of our time in the next couple months marketing for this one
1:05:51
experiment we don't really prove that much for it and marketing isn't our core like that's not our core expertise at
1:05:56
the moment so that was that was another big takeaway we all set some takeaways
1:06:02
on just on the insights on UX in my again user experience for none defy I'll
1:06:08
say none define native users and use cases is still a massive problem like
1:06:13
what the hell is die how does meta mask work onboarding non crypto native users
1:06:19
in our case scientists or even just people that are really interested in like supporting psychedelic research or
1:06:26
we did a bunch of reddit threads and people were just like but how the hell like do I do I get from here to here and
1:06:32
of course you can only send so many guides but in the end you have to be realistic around yeah around onboarding
1:06:38
the masses at this stage another surprising insight for me was the UI for bonding curves is what surprising you
1:06:44
know not a big issue like people just kind of like trust it in the system and they were like okay this seems this
1:06:49
seems good but we I think we expected really nonsense that there would be much more apprehension towards new I of like
1:06:56
the users understanding what is happening here but that was surprising I mean not the bigger issue we have to say
1:07:02
is whether we invested very heavily into into a good UI development for it and
1:07:07
actually shout out to Michael Schaff man who yeah was a lead UX and UI designer on your did an amazing job
1:07:13
last point that defy liquidity for non crypto use cases in my opinion is also
1:07:18
still way too small there's just not enough liquidity moving around in the ecosystem to really say you know what let's like let's finance a
1:07:25
real estate development project I think we're still at a stage where we're gonna struggle with these yeah none non crypto
1:07:32
excuse cases where we're not trying to sell yeah we were trying to connect this with the real world maybe just a very
1:07:41
quick rundown like what's next for us after this first experiment so we actually had a post of of research
1:07:47
projects from various universities so this one with Toronto we have another one with the University of Copenhagen that we were planning to launch with
1:07:54
catalyst now we just realized that hey this is this partially do the ux/ui
1:08:01
problem partially due to liquidity this isn't the best fit so what's next for us is really that we're just we're
1:08:06
initially building for those for that user base we're saying let's focus very heavily on this user base because this
1:08:12
this part we can we can do we can always bring this end but let's let's put but this side first and take a more web 2.0
1:08:18
approach and do private syndicated financings first this is what also what you could consider building that initial
1:08:25
seed community but saying you know what like bank accounts for the time being work and equity is still a thing
1:08:31
the second is get the legal engineering right something that we're going to invest in quite heavily then step three
1:08:40
is create more research and patient communities a research and patient community development around the
1:08:45
individual assets before saying taking them the full nine yards still like a public public listed moniker and then
1:08:52
and then slowly start reintroducing web 3.0 principles starting centralizing these communities in a similar way that
1:08:58
reddit has done this saying we have a community we can start decentralizing that as opposed to the other way around
1:09:04
start implementing token engineering and then really go into a more open market approach again and n taos and this works
1:09:11
for us together quite well I don't know how I'm doing on time but yeah that was
1:09:17
that was it please feel free to email me if you have any questions um if you want to collab on anything perfect thank you
1:09:25
Paul no so the timeless so everybody if you want to get in touch
1:09:30
Paulette molecule teo is that is the email address I actually had one question but I'm not sure if you can
1:09:36
answer it in like same minutes well you you basically said that you wanted to have a you know be fair you you took a
1:09:44
linear boning curve because you wanted to be fair to users I think that's what you said but I also know you experimented with sigmoid curves and you
1:09:51
know when you talk about fairness I think you know if you really dig into it then you could probably argue that you know later users they have less risk and
1:09:57
there's dynamics and the development of this compound can you just like maybe it's a few sentences about different you
1:10:03
know the trade-offs or the you know in in choosing a specific bonding curve design I think that I would find that
1:10:09
insightful yeah I think I actually have an article on that which is called token
1:10:16
bond and curve design parameters it's a little bit older already but it talks about some of the trade-offs perfect
1:10:24
then yeah exactly called then maybe people can just reference that it's called token bonding curve design
1:10:31
parameters I'll just I'll post the link into the chat just now but I mean to
1:10:37
answer your question I we felt or like I mean I personally feel that like a
1:10:42
linear bonding curve has like a relatively slow and steady growth as opposed to as opposed to a sigmoidal
1:10:49
curve which can have a very slow growth initially and then as a strong growth period we I mean we made this choice
1:10:57
because we wanted to experiment with a simple design first there's a saying that like don't innovate in like too
1:11:03
many areas at the same time we felt we were already innovating in so many that like a simple design seemed to make more
1:11:09
sense I think it's it's entirely it's entirely use case dependent what type of
1:11:17
curve you yeah what type of curve you choose I would definitely try and model
1:11:23
it with like the real world like does this make sense in the real world yeah I do think though for other use cases like
1:11:29
if you're trading memes you could you could because there's no I mean there's a fundamental question there like if
1:11:35
we're trading the ownership of a meme like what are we group what is this is it a piece of vibe
1:11:40
is there attainable values of a collector's item and in those cases like I think you can go for very crazy
1:11:45
designs and just like experiment yeah I
1:11:50
don't know if that's what we answered your question no no perfect thank you so much I and I wanted to add I think what would I like about this project
1:11:56
specifically is that it's very pretty medic you guys some of your potential customers on your board I'm not sure
1:12:01
exactly that's right but I think a lot of projects could have saved themselves a lot of troubles if they would have approached it you know from a from a
1:12:08
market perspective and lucky us so next up is Jeff from the comments deck Jeff
Design Archetype: "Augmented" Bonding Curves, Jeff Emmett
1:12:14
is a talking engineering research at the comments sector comments sectin tree need an introduction it's one of the most I think ambitious but also exciting
1:12:21
projects out there at the moment and he's also publishing like crazy like you
1:12:27
know like you could spend the whole weekend bench bench reading his articles and you should I think and he's also
1:12:32
working with locksense on a couple of things and doctors Aragon was going to present later so we're looking forward
1:12:38
at Jeff to the talk on the Augmented bonding curve design archetype
1:12:45
awesome let me just share my screen here can everybody see the presentation okay
1:12:55
cool well first off I'll just make a note that I am my laptop is having some
1:13:01
audio encoding issues so if there is any issue with my audio just feel free to drop a message in the chat and I'll get
1:13:07
closer to the computer but I'll assume that everyone can hear me from this point cool so yeah I'm here to present
1:13:16
the design archetype of the Augmented bonding curve and as Paul mentioned in the last conversation I think all of the
1:13:23
presentations today are on augmented bonding curves and in some way or another and I think that the big
1:13:30
question is you know what what makes a bonding curve augmented I got into this space reading a lot of the work from
1:13:38
Simon from Paul from Zargon as well and I think naming is a is a continual
1:13:44
difficulty in this space as Simon can can attest to and I am yeah the
1:13:50
augmentation in the bonding curve and the context of the common stack is these properties that are formally defined
1:13:56
with mathematical invariants been talked a little bit about invariants in in
1:14:02
bonding curves and autom automated market-makers but we have this invariant
1:14:07
coefficient that is you know some ratio between the supply and the reserve and
1:14:14
Kappa and a few other terms in these invariants so the great thing about
1:14:21
invariances they provide mathematical stability on which we can do further
1:14:27
token engineering and the token engineering allows us to integrate these
1:14:32
context appropriate mechanisms so in the common stack for example we have an
1:14:37
initialization phase which Paul mentioned could could benefit you know the next launch of a molecule bonding
1:14:44
curve we can integrate entry and exit taxes we can integrate vesting periods
1:14:49
and all sorts of other mechanisms that build the kind of usefulness of the
1:14:55
bonding curve to a context in which it's used
1:15:00
so this brings us to the engineering design process and as I'm sure some of
1:15:06
you have seen before this starts with mathematical foundations then we go into modeling how these flows move through a
1:15:14
system in a stock and flow diagram and then plugging those into the CAD cad
1:15:20
Python framework allows us to simulate and determine all of the ways that these
1:15:26
systems may react to various agent behaviors and also give us important
1:15:31
insight into where they may fail moving forward so that we can design appropriate failure protection into the
1:15:39
mechanisms before we go to code and launch these in a real world environment
1:15:45
so diving a little bit into the math this can be a little bit overwhelming but if you are of the mathematical bent
1:15:52
there is a lot more in under the hood of the common stack augmented bonding curve but essentially what you see over and
1:15:59
over is this invariant V knot or the power invariant function so we have a
1:16:05
deposit to mint or a bond to mint equation they burn to a throw equation
1:16:10
always this invariant stays constant and on that invariant we can design higher-order mathematics that that are
1:16:17
stable because they're resting on this mathematical invariant and when we turn
1:16:24
this into the system stock and flow diagram it's it's important to note that
1:16:30
bonding curves on their own aren't actually anything there their value
1:16:35
transfer interface but where it gets interesting is when you integrate it into a system that can use it for
1:16:40
something so this is a system diagram of the common stack use case so in the top left here you see the bond to mint and
1:16:48
burn to withdraw mechanisms that we just looked at the math hat in the previous slide so when a user inputs reserve say
1:16:55
in dye that is bonded to the curve and some supply of tokens is minted and
1:17:01
issued to that user when that user burns the supply he can or she can claim a
1:17:09
portion of the collateral as we discussed the with draw is taxed and that tax goes
1:17:17
into a funding pool in in the common stack scenario and that funding pool is actually used to create incentive for
1:17:24
community members to create or carry out work proposals so whatever work needs to
1:17:31
be done in that community whether that's producing open source code or cleaning up beaches or housing the homeless this
1:17:37
funding pool is fed by this withdraw friction or exit tax and then from this
1:17:47
CAD CAD model we can plug it into the data science framework and we can start modeling and testing our assumptions so
1:17:53
what you see here on the blue line is the invariant of the bonding curve and also the price from the mathematical
1:18:00
formula and then all of these dots are sampling so basically we ran we ran this
1:18:05
through parameter sweeps and various agent behaviors Monte Carlo analyses and we can see that the observed data so
1:18:12
when we when we test this in the system all of these yeah we're finding that the
1:18:18
invariant holds and we're finding that the price stays on the curve throughout so we're basically just verifying our
1:18:25
assumptions that these invariants hold under under various conditions when we actually use the bonding curve
1:18:33
so why are invariance so important invariants actually enable stable design
1:18:39
and we see this all over the place in civil engineering Newton's laws are used
1:18:44
like balancing forces when we're creating a building we need to make sure that it doesn't fall down so we use
1:18:51
formulas like force equals mass times acceleration in electrical engineering we have Kirchhoff's laws B equals IR and
1:18:59
all of the higher-order mathematics that can come out of that invariant in token
1:19:04
engineering we have tsar Gomes laws so this is the the bonding curve invariant
1:19:10
on which we can design again derive higher-order mathematics and this
1:19:16
essentially enables us to engineer economic space for agent interaction so
1:19:25
what can we do with economic space this essentially allows us to create
1:19:31
incentive landscapes where you can encourage beneficial behavior in your community so in the example that we just
1:19:38
spoke about in the common stack taking profits or selling out of the curve you
1:19:43
pay an exit tribute so that costs you money your your up on this hill we're not saying you can't do it but it's
1:19:49
going to you have to exert some energy to get up that hill
1:19:54
on the contrary completing work proposals in this community is actually incentivized
1:20:00
so you'll see this this ball is an agent in the system it's more likely for this ball to end up in the valley where it's
1:20:07
incentivized its rewarded with tokens for completing work proposals as opposed to exiting the system now we're not
1:20:14
saying they can't do that they certainly can but they're more likely to be
1:20:19
following the incentivized behavior rather than the disincentivized behavior
1:20:24
so this is a tool for internalizing externalities in a community another
1:20:30
example you could look at this is in carbon offset credits if you pollute you
1:20:36
have to pay you climb this hill we're not saying that you can't climb the hill but we're saying we would prefer you to
1:20:42
cut your carbon costs and be in this valley and actually the the fees the taxes that
1:20:49
are incurred on the people who are polluting are subsidizing the people who are cutting their their carbon footprint
1:20:56
so this is essentially a tool for aligning incentives in the economic fabric of our societies
1:21:04
and a lot of people ask you know will this work these are pretty radical
1:21:10
claims this is brand-new design space so we look to real-world engineering
1:21:15
parallels where this already works today and we can see whether you know this will be a viable tool for us in aligning
1:21:22
economic incentives so the math for the Augmented bonding curve is actually derived from something called Lyapunov
1:21:28
functions which you can look into it's quite deep and abstract but essentially
1:21:34
they're energy conservation equations so this is like defining the gravity for a
1:21:39
system used in swarm robotics for actually decentralized multi-agent
1:21:47
estimation and coordination which is believe it or not what what we are essentially doing in the crypto space as
1:21:53
well we have decentralized control of multiple agents estimating so in other
1:21:58
words determining how we're going to evolve these community structures and
1:22:03
how we coordinate in a decentralized fashion to move forward the goals of our community so in the example of swarm
1:22:10
robotics you can see here these these drone swarms so each drone doesn't have an individual human pilot and they
1:22:17
actually have a complex algorithm where maybe you deploy these seven drones to
1:22:22
cover an area with stable Wi-Fi signal so these drones essentially sense each
1:22:29
other they can pick up the Wi-Fi signal from all the drones around them and they use this Lyapunov function to
1:22:36
essentially slide into the like using this gravity equation to the appropriate
1:22:42
place where they are providing best coverage so that's actually if you if we go back to this diagram you can picture
1:22:49
this as a drone and as it's detecting its optimal spot for Wi-Fi coverage it
1:22:55
kind of slides into this this optimal spot for it to provide that coverage so
1:23:03
we have lots of established engineering tools and and practices that we can now
1:23:09
apply in this new economic realm and and align incentives in new ways
1:23:16
but people aren't Rome's so how do we know that they're going to respond to these incentives so essentially if we if
1:23:23
we think about designing economic space the same way we design physical space we
1:23:29
have all sorts of architectural design so a parking lot is a good example we paint lines on the ground and we say hey
1:23:36
cars if you park within these lines then we'll have order and we can fit more cars as opposed to everyone just parking
1:23:43
everywhere and in most cases this does help guide useful behavior cars generally follow the painted lines and
1:23:50
we have some semblance of order in a parking lot but of course in some cases
1:23:56
this isn't the case humans are unpredictable humans can do basically
1:24:01
whatever they they see fit but that doesn't mean that the architectural design of the parking lot is not a
1:24:08
useful design framing for us to to use and we can do this now in the economic
1:24:14
realm despite the fact that people are sometimes irrational or unpredictable agents
1:24:23
so essentially we're building towards a future of aligned incentives this is a
1:24:28
great diagram that Kevin awoke II at get coin put out in a tweet thread a few
1:24:34
weeks back on aligning the moral and the economic landscape and his point was that the needs of our societies in other
1:24:42
words our moral landscape is often quite different from the economic incentives that we have in in our capitalist
1:24:50
societies so the bonding curve is essentially a tool that we can use to shape our economic landscapes and the
1:24:57
the incentive fields that we apply in those economies to more closely match
1:25:03
the moral landscape of our communities and that's not saying we need to do it at a global scale at a national scale
1:25:10
but we can do it at a community scale and it can scale up from there so this is a way that we can really
1:25:15
align these incentives of actors in an economy to match the socially beneficial
1:25:21
outcomes that are desired in our communities so to wrap up bonding curves
1:25:29
are augmented with invariance and contextualized design these invariants
1:25:34
allow for token engineering modeling and simulation which is an essential part of these complex tools moving forward and
1:25:41
they enable the use of established engineering tools things like low-pass filters Coleman filters Bayesian
1:25:48
analysis all of these engineering tools that have plenty of precedent in the
1:25:54
real world today we can now apply in the crypto economic realm and this will
1:25:59
allow us to architect economic space which opens up an entire new design space that warrants much further
1:26:05
exploration and a lot of the projects that are in this presentation today and
1:26:10
all of these presentations today are really pioneers in exploring this space
1:26:16
and and there's much more to come so thanks for your attention and if you
1:26:21
have some interest in diving deeper into the mathematics or some of the applications of bonding curves one that
1:26:28
that isn't presented today is the REDCROSS community inclusion currencies so happy to provide some links to dive
1:26:35
in deeper there and if anyone is interested I have a bit of time for questions I believe
1:26:43
yeah thanks Jeff are there any questions for Jeff the Augmented bonding curve
1:26:50
design archetype where can we find the
1:26:56
links someone is asking I will share the presentation with Jonathan and he can
1:27:03
make sure it goes out perhaps with the present with the recording fantastic
1:27:09
then let's see somebody's asking morals
1:27:16
can shift over time how do we handle that and that was very close to a question came up before which was about
1:27:22
how do we determine good a good a bad outcomes I'm not sure if that's a question that can be efficiently handled
1:27:30
if you have I can give a really really short answer so essentially what we're
1:27:35
designing here are cybernetic systems and cybernetic systems are are steered by humans but this when we steer them
1:27:42
they're also steering us so they're second-order cybernetic systems and that's a very good point because if we
1:27:47
just set you know the the incentive and then we can't change it then we'll be stuck in you know whatever the the ethos
1:27:54
of the time is so these systems need to evolve and this is where things like
1:27:59
conviction voting could come in so in the common stack example we have the ability to upgrade these systems through
1:28:06
the governance of the commoners in these systems the community members through
1:28:11
their token Holdings can evolve the the incentives and the the goals of this
1:28:17
community which of course is very important whenever you have humans in the loop we need to make sure these
1:28:23
systems can evolve and continue to represent the needs of that community
1:28:30
awesome thank you I would take the one minute to make a quick announcement so we're
Join Token Engineering Switzerland
1:28:37
looking for somebody to join us at token engineering Switzerland somebody who's interested in organizing these awesome
1:28:43
events with us and the benefits really are you get introduced to all of these beautiful people and speakers and really
1:28:50
can network very efficiently so if you personally or if somebody in your network
1:28:55
might want to join us immortan me to organize the third event probably in probably in August then yeah get in
1:29:02
touch I just wanted to put this out there and then next speaker is Griff Griff is also such a well-known thought
Case Study II: The Commons Stack, Griff Green
1:29:09
leader in the space that he doesn't really need an introduction he's been around since the early days since the Dow I think Griff you've been a
1:29:15
community manager at the Dow you founded and you were very much involved in cleaning up the mess he founded the
1:29:21
co-founded the white hat hacker group and you now dedicate your life to to the
1:29:28
common stack thanks thanks a lot Jonathan and thanks for getting us all
1:29:35
here this has been an amazing event so far I hope I can continue it we'll see
1:29:40
so at the common stack our main mission and the final product that we want to
1:29:46
produce is something that will take any community that wants to create funding
1:29:51
for public goods basically a create a sustainable system for you know things
1:29:57
that are generally considered nonprofit causes and have any normal group come in
1:30:04
have their hand held and be able to create a system that will allow them to
1:30:09
create value the value that they want to create and so I'm supposed to get and I
1:30:14
used to case study of this but we haven't gotten one yet so I have decided to make one up around bonny curves
1:30:21
because while our final goal is to of course take this to you know help people
1:30:27
that are protesting in the states right now for instance but we're not it's
1:30:33
going to take us time to get there and so our expectations are to start with the communities that we're involved in
1:30:39
and look we're seeing the community right here so I bet there's some really
1:30:44
great public goods that the bonding curve space could could use funding to
1:30:49
produce and let's talk about how we
1:30:55
would use an Augmented bonding curve to fund public goods within the bonding curve space so the first step of course
1:31:02
is to find the community stewards the Commons
1:31:08
which is what we call our our granted bonding curve Dow and is a community and
1:31:16
all communities start with a small group of people that get together to make a change and at least within the common
1:31:23
space and so if it's gonna be a bonding curve comments these these group of this
1:31:29
group of friends will need to be respected leaders within the community and they're going to hold the Commons
1:31:35
identity they're going to be the ones that need to really explicitly state what is the value you intend to create
1:31:42
is this bonding curve Commons just a tool for all the large you know crypto
1:31:48
ico organizations to kind of like collaborate and get some you know CAD
1:31:54
CAD designs for what they're trying to build or is the goal of this bonding curve Commons to bring a revolution in
1:32:01
economics to all of society and change the world economies these are the things
1:32:06
this this kind of scope is very important to have everyone who's participating aligned around as Paul
1:32:15
said in his talk it's it's it's really hard to just kind of come in with tech
1:32:20
and expect everything to work out here's these cool tools guys we just made them for you let's let's let's do cool stuff
1:32:27
what do you want to do now it doesn't work like that you have to figure out what you want to do first and the people
1:32:33
who are actually going to who are experts in the bonding curves need to be
1:32:39
the ones designing the bonding curve comments and saying what the goals are saying what the values are saying the
1:32:46
vision and figuring out how are we going to evolve with the community if our
1:32:51
morals change how do we change our Constitution and having all of these things written down and what is you know
1:32:59
explicitly stating what the value is that they're creating this economy around and this this what we call the
1:33:06
cultural build is gonna take a long time it's not what I'm talking about building
1:33:11
economies here you know this idea of just Dow it is not gonna work we need to
1:33:17
it hasn't worked so far I think it's and it's great for prototyping and an
1:33:22
but if you actually want to make it change you need to put in the cultural the cultural work so once you have all
1:33:30
the the purpose of the Commons stated of the bonding curb comments then you
1:33:36
actually need to create some road maps and just do some project management right there's the legal requirements as
1:33:42
Paul talked about these are very interesting and a lot of work the technical requirements of course maybe
1:33:49
do some CAD CAD modeling the social requirements the financial requirements to pull this all off getting those
1:33:56
roadmaps and aligning them together while also making sure that you're actually building the comments and
1:34:01
following the best practices that we know today from the social science research mostly from Elinor Ostrom but
1:34:08
also David Polly and Michelle ballons and many other leading or thought
1:34:14
leaders out there and so okay you have this plan you have this roadmap you have the vision that's great but you need to
1:34:21
kind of share it with the world might go a circle outside so the community stewards are generally putting
1:34:26
this all together for the bonding curve Commons but then they actually need to go talk to you know talk to Zara go talk
1:34:33
to Simon talk to Paul I guess I put all the other pictures in the in the first picture but talk to the people who are
1:34:40
that one circle out that you that you want to be involved in this thing and get some feedback figure out if you're
1:34:47
if what you're building and what you're proposing and the value that you want to produce is actually going to be
1:34:52
appreciated by those guys okay so once you have the people and the actual
1:34:57
cultural plan then you can start recruiting the people who are going to fund this thing so an Augmented bonding
1:35:05
curve is actually generally expecting a input of capital this capital is most
1:35:14
likely going to be a stable token like die that's how molecule molecule used in and
1:35:19
it's probably the most simple use case of course it can be some kind of like labour token like source credit Green or
1:35:26
or there's other experiments that you could use but in general you need people to kick-start this thing to actually
1:35:32
have money and want to see the value that your community is going to produce actually exist and these are what we
1:35:39
call Hatcher's and the Hatcher's will come in because they care about the
1:35:46
system and it's important that you are selective with your Hatcher's because if
1:35:51
you choose because the Hatcher's while they are generously providing seed capital they do that for a reason they
1:35:58
do that because they want to help steer this community and they and they do that by getting governance tokens and if you
1:36:05
let people who are more profit driven than value driven into your
1:36:11
initialization of the Augmented bonding curve it's likely that you're gonna end up with a coin and you don't want
1:36:18
that you want to end up with a really good system that's going to produce the
1:36:23
value that you want to create not just try to make money so ok now you have all
1:36:31
the people now and and the plan now you got to go out another circle socially you have to go tell the world about your
1:36:39
plan tell hey this is what we're doing it's just about to start I get get kind
1:36:44
of the hype cycle up so that people know that this economy is about to be kick-started but also I you you want to
1:36:52
find people who want to do work for this community one cool thing about the
1:36:57
Augmented bombing curve is that in a way it's a circular economy the people the Hatcher's that are putting money in they
1:37:04
can actually use the money that they put in to fund the projects that they want to do they can fund themselves and
1:37:10
that's actually very preferable but it's it's not you don't want it to be just a
1:37:16
closed circular economy you want to be an open growing circular economy so while you might have some projects that
1:37:22
you want to fund it's better to have competition of those projects so if you can publish your plan then more people
1:37:28
can come in and join the party ok so let's talk about finally where we get to
1:37:34
more of the technical implementation but it's worth say it's focusing on the cultural I just want to I know that
1:37:40
we're all kind of like tech nerds but we got to remember these are socio-economic systems so while we talk about the tech
1:37:46
all the time culture is most important but now that we're actually going to
1:37:52
launch a bonding curve we start these with what we call hatches the hatch is well I'll talk about what it I'll go a
1:38:00
little bit deeper into this right now so the first thing is the Hatcher's finding the people that are willing to put money
1:38:05
in when they put those funds in those funds are split between two pools the
1:38:10
reserve which as you heard before it backs the bonding curve and in our case
1:38:15
actually backs the value of the bonding curve Commons tokens and is really
1:38:21
effectively the reserve of the bonding curve economy and then there's the
1:38:27
funding pool the funding pool is what is used to actually incentivize little
1:38:33
labour and to do work this is a donation the funding pool is where the donations go so the Hatcher's need to be very
1:38:39
generous in this case during the cultural build the bonding curve Commons decided to send 60% of the hatch to the
1:38:47
reserve and 40% of the hatched funds to the funding pool so effectively 40% of the hatches don't
1:38:54
money that they raised was a donation to the bonding curve of Commons and they
1:39:00
did this because they in return get really cheap on incur tokens but those
1:39:07
bonding curve tokens because of slippage there they need to be vested they need
1:39:12
to be locked because well I'll show you in this next slide when you actually do
1:39:19
it when you if there's one thing to know about bonding curves it's a it's always
1:39:25
best to be the first person in to buy and this is just almost a law of bonding curves because the bonding curve price
1:39:32
in general will always be going up as the as the collateral pool grows as the
1:39:39
reserve grows so when you bulk buy at the beginning you can kind of average
1:39:45
that advantage out so that you get a lot of people put money in in this case they
1:39:51
put in $500,000 died and they bought tokens at ten cents so five million
1:39:57
tokens were created and but those tokens are only back those five million
1:40:04
tokens are only backed by 300k in the reserve so now these five million tokens
1:40:11
are effectively backed by six cents each token is back by six cents but when the
1:40:18
token goes to market after the hatch when when it's when the bonding curve is open for everyone to purchase to
1:40:25
interact with the price of the token is 20 cents so for the Hatcher's they have
1:40:33
kind of this dual price in their mind they know that their love their vested
1:40:38
tokens are only worth 6 cents if if they're cut if the bonding curve Commons
1:40:43
completely fails and they just end up selling all of their tokens as they become vested 300k will be able to come
1:40:51
out of the reserve and that's six cents per token but the open price and the
1:40:56
price that everyone gets to see is twenty cents now this is very motivating this this is due to the slippage in in
1:41:06
the design of the bonding trip and because their tokens are locked they kind of have this carrot that they're
1:41:13
chasing the Hatcher's of the bonding curve that they need to develop real value with the system that they started
1:41:19
and the way they develop the value is by spending the funding pool diligently
1:41:25
that they actually now they have skin in the game if they do a good job at spending the donations that they that
1:41:32
they raise together then they will undoubtedly attract other people that
1:41:37
want to be part of this community and act almost as a bonding curve Commons
1:41:43
impact investment and the so they need to make decisions good decisions that
1:41:51
will support the growth of this community and also and the best way to do that of course is to have the in have
1:41:59
the impact that you said you would have to follow your values and achieve your
1:42:04
mission and and that would be by funding open source bonding curve projects and one thing I want to mention here is kind
1:42:11
of an aside is it's very important with art is in the common stack design that you don't just send dye to the
1:42:18
projects that are that are that are being funded you actually always want to
1:42:24
you can use the dye as kind of a stable escrow and but when the open-source
1:42:31
bonding curve project wants to actually collect the payment that dye goes back
1:42:36
into the bonding curve into the reserve and creates bonding curve tokens bond
1:42:42
teacher Commons tokens and those are what pay the people doing work for the
1:42:48
Commons and this is great for two reasons number one you always want to use your own currency and that that
1:42:53
allows money to kind of stay in your system and create a circular economy and
1:42:59
number two these are the people doing work these are the people on the ground you want them to have a part it's an
1:43:06
easy way to participate and this is a way that you can allow labor to to
1:43:11
create governance and governance power within the system so the reason that
1:43:19
it's it's very easy to start growing once you have this system is that in our most basic design when when people want
1:43:27
to join it's it's at first they see it's very clear that it's it's it's an easy
1:43:34
decision because in the end when they put in a hundred died and during the open phase
1:43:40
to join the bonding curve Commons they receive $100 that bonding curve tokens
1:43:45
and when they do that the price goes up because of the bombing Kirk does the
1:43:51
design and they're growing the internal economy so at no cost to them they are
1:43:57
seemingly no cost to them at this stage they are increasing the value of the
1:44:03
bonding curve Commons and so they'll do this if you if the bonding her Commons does a good job and they can see it as
1:44:11
an impact investment this is much better for a grant granting organization to do this than it is to just give away their
1:44:17
funds it's effectively a no loss donation but you of course need a way to
1:44:25
sustain the growth of the funding pool so you can continue so the bonding care count can continue to do good work and this is
1:44:32
where we implement what we call an exit tribute and in the exit tribute when people leave you actually and they they
1:44:40
they burn their tokens into the bonds of the bonding curve and release the die even though they when they burn $100 the
1:44:48
bonding curved tokens hundred die is actually released from the reserve in
1:44:54
the exit tribute we will take for example 20% and put it in the funding
1:45:00
pool and then the person who's exiting gets eighty die back and this is a
1:45:05
pretty steep exit tribute and what this does is this aligns incentives so that as Jeff mentioned you know if people are
1:45:11
doing actions that don't really serve the Commons they have decide to take some profits maybe they bought Commons
1:45:17
tokens in the hatch and they want to you know make they did good work to grow the
1:45:22
community so they want to sell their tokens and take a profit that's great they should be able to do that but at
1:45:28
the same time we want to take that as an opportunity to grow the funding pool now this is just one of endless number of
1:45:36
ways to grow the funding pool and really you know bonding curves are up to you
1:45:41
this is your opportunity to design whatever system you want in the community stewards would would do this
1:45:47
and they get bigger to have the power it's like a Bob Ross ping team and you don't have to follow what Bob Ross says
1:45:53
I just need to grow fro and then one day I can be like Bob I that's that's the
1:46:00
show we have so many links here Jeff put up some of them too we we have a really great community and
1:46:07
we would love all of you guys to join one of the important things that we talked about in the comment stack is the
1:46:13
cultural build and to me that means that we need people like you guys in this call to really put yourselves out there
1:46:21
to be part of future communities that want to implement these systems so one
1:46:27
of one of our components is the trusted seed and this is the group of token
1:46:33
engineering experts and Commons experts and and really pro-social altruistic people that can be you know kind of like
1:46:41
plants in future Commons can knees and be part of the hatches to make sure that these early common early
1:46:48
adopters of this kind of stuff have people that they can rely on for good
1:46:53
information so if you want to be part of our mission and part of our part of our
1:46:58
community please consider applying at common stock dollar org slash apply yeah
1:47:05
thank you guys Griffin the meantime I'd have a question
1:47:10
so what are the next steps for the comment stack and how long is it going to take before this becomes a reality well you know it's a we're doing our own
1:47:17
cultural build right now we have finally I feel like we finally got enough people
1:47:23
in the trusted seed to start address to start really building their building
1:47:28
their system I assume it's like hi there's a real world over here sometimes
1:47:33
we forget right so our goal is now to start start with an MVP comments and
1:47:41
this is what we want to do because when we started the common stack we thought we would kind of go really fast and
1:47:48
lunch lunch the Commons you know raise a bunch of money and start building this stuff but we found that it was a lot
1:47:55
harder to do that and especially learning lessons like like molecule did about what needs to be done the
1:48:01
groundwork that really needs to be done on the social side we have instead really you know gone slower and now look
1:48:10
the world is catching up with us people are implementing our ideas before we can so we're really excited about taking the
1:48:17
tools that exist today and and really trying to do a Commons like a prototype comments awesome thank you let's see if
1:48:27
there is another question here it's kind of sexy key to developing on on earth
1:48:32
using dying or are there other chains you're interested in so we have a very interesting development approach our
1:48:39
strategy and this is almost controversial sometimes we don't want a dead team I know that sounds crazy but I
1:48:46
I've seen what's happened in other communities around like kind of getting
1:48:51
entrenched in having a monopoly over a code base we're going to keep our weird creative monopolies on a codebase but
1:48:58
actually it's black science that I'll create the monopoly on the codebase we want to create really good designs for
1:49:04
these systems that can be applied on any blockchain we don't care it's not the point isn't to bring value to aetherium
1:49:11
we're to bring value to Bitcoin the point is the fund to support altruistic
1:49:17
communities that want to create sustainable value and whatever tools
1:49:22
work yeah you know for us the focus is the design so yeah actually aetherium is
1:49:29
probably the place to start I like X died as a sidechain to build on
1:49:34
one hive I don't know if they've announced it I don't know but they they're they're going to move Aragon to
1:49:41
X died if it's not there already so I'm very excited to start playing there where gas is cheap and we can use all
1:49:47
the tools that they already have with a stable currency that people have access to and it makes a lot of sense to start
1:49:55
with the theorem because it's easy but when we do these big builds that we have
1:50:01
planned multiple iterations with different focuses on different layers I
1:50:07
hope that will actually kind of do one on each different change and give a
1:50:12
variety of code bases so that we have multiple teams with multiple expert and
1:50:17
with expertise in using these systems in different environments and then it can
1:50:23
be a competition to see which ones are best awesome Thank You Grif so let's
1:50:29
move on to the next talk I'd like to introduce Shruti appear she's a research scientist with formal complex systems
Design Archetype: Dynamic, Risk-adjusted Bonding Curves, Shruti Appiah
1:50:37
engineering education she really is a pioneering computational engineering of cryptic anomic systems she was a founder
1:50:45
of consensus of consensus labs I think which is a venture studio she's been a 30 under 30 and she's currently working
1:50:52
on a really exciting system design that she's going to speak about today which
1:50:58
is including a bonding curve which is risk adjustable Trudy we're looking
1:51:05
forward to your presentation that's great all right I will show my screen I hope
1:51:11
you all can see it yeah sweet
1:51:19
so thanks for the intro Jeff I mean Jonathan that was very helpful because I
1:51:26
do have a slide out here Oh what is going on here thank you no I cannot want to do this
1:51:34
you you
1:51:42
all right okay so today I'm going to be talking about risk-adjusted bonding
1:51:49
curves so this is a slight variation on the traditional bonding curve and we will be exploring the differences and
1:51:55
the contrast between the traditional bonding curve to the risk-adjusted bonding curve which were exploring for
1:52:03
developing social impact bonds so let's
1:52:09
go into the next slide all right so I think that Jonathan did every really
1:52:14
good intro for me so I will skip the slide and then we'll do a little bit of
1:52:20
conceptual review of what's going on with the traditional bonding curve and
1:52:26
how it's designed with regards to configuration spaces and as well as economic games as estimators so a lot of
1:52:32
these concepts are actually applied in the bonding curve that graph as well as
1:52:37
Jeff's talked about and it's also applied in this particular variation so
1:52:43
this is a lot of this is a concept from robotics engineering and systems engineering configuration spaces where
1:52:51
you you want to you have a system and the system has a lot of states and in
1:52:58
order to deal with all of those states and your computations in those states you'll typically want to make that space
1:53:05
a little bit smaller so that that that smaller space actually describes the
1:53:10
states of the system that you care about and that are relevant to your system design so in order to do that what we do
1:53:18
is that we impose constraints on the general state space and then once we
1:53:23
impose those constraints we get configuration spaces so these constraints are typically in the form of
1:53:30
conservation functions and I think Jeff also really did a very good job in describing as to what the conservation
1:53:40
functions can be and these are typically simply conservation energy conservation functions such as the Leonel function as
1:53:46
well as several functions that we see in Newton's laws as well as Kirchhoff's
1:53:52
laws etc and now we have we have these conservation functions that are applied
1:53:58
to bonding curves so once we impose those conservation functions we obtain a
1:54:03
configuration space which is much smaller and of much lower dimension than the general state space so so once we do
1:54:13
have that we also need to be able to get certain information from the system that
1:54:20
we don't have and inside of right so and this information we typically classify
1:54:25
as private information so if you think of all of us as individuals we all hold private thoughts and private beliefs of
1:54:32
what certain things of the system should be so for example if you have a system
1:54:38
where there is a notion of price right such as a token bonding curve system the
1:54:43
price that you think or how you value the token is only an information that's
1:54:49
in your head if you don't share it with anyone else right and so in order to extract that information from all the
1:54:57
agents what we do is we use an estimator so an estimator basically takes inputs
1:55:03
of the agents actions and the inputs act as signals to the estimator and then the
1:55:09
estimator processes those signals to produce a system estimate of certain certain state variable and that state
1:55:16
variable can be something like price or it can be something like alpha which is what we will explore further so let's
1:55:23
talk a little bit about bonding curves and what I'm referring to here so I want this to be a comprehensive presentation
1:55:30
right can I quickly interrupt I'm having
1:55:54
audio problems here I'm not sure if that's from your microphone could somebody same here okay
1:55:59
maybe there's a issue with the connectivity of your microphone surely oh that's unfortunate let me I don't
1:56:07
know changed something you know it's perfect was it was it a physical interruption or
1:56:13
that's a good question it's good now
1:56:18
okay okay I'll do it this way all right so so in in typical bonding curves you
1:56:24
have buying cell functions and those will either mint tokens or burn tokens and however a shortcoming in this
1:56:32
tradition pointing car for certain application or use cases is that these bonding curves have fixed a priori
1:56:38
assumptions meaning that once you start the morning curve there are certain things about the state variables that you are able to change so especially in
1:56:46
the use case that we are going to talk about today which is that of a social impact bond and the impact bond being a
1:56:52
bond which is used as a debt instrument to fund social impact projects which are
1:56:59
dependent on the outcome of the project um in those kinds of cases the risk
1:57:05
factor or the external factors that contribute to risk or the success of or
1:57:10
the likelihood of success of the of the project is extremely important to
1:57:16
consider while the project is - during execution so the reason why we want to
1:57:22
incorporate you know dynamic state variables is because of the fact that we
1:57:29
want to account for risk and account for external factors doing while a project
1:57:34
is during execution so most funding curves are static so we will explore
1:57:40
dynamic bonding curve so this presentation so also let's talk a little
1:57:47
bit more about the risks or the shortcomings of static morning curves so
1:57:53
since they have a prairie fixed a priori assumptions they aren't able to incorporate risk or certain external
1:57:58
factors during their execution which is during their life or dynamic phase and as a result of that tokens make it
1:58:04
misallocated and risk sometimes will accumulate nonlinearly if that's the way the relationship is and as a result of
1:58:11
that there can be either systemic collapse or investors get poor ROI so the former one which is that investors
1:58:17
get poor ROI is usually the it's usually the outcome of this and systemic collapses can happen
1:58:24
technically speaking when the risk is accumulating nonlinearly so during closeout which is when the entire
1:58:30
project is completed you will often see one of these two outcomes if you're going to be using static model curves in
1:58:36
conjunction with a social impact project or a social impact bond that has a ton
1:58:42
of external risk factors and all of those kinds of relationships are very
1:58:47
strong there so so one what we can do
1:58:52
instead is we can continuously estimate the likelihood of the bond success given
1:58:58
all of the external factors that we find out about during its execution so what
1:59:04
we have is that there is a data stream which is that of external factors and
1:59:09
risk and we aren't able to capture any of that any of the information that's in
1:59:16
that data stream with the static bonding curve but with this type of a bonding curve we are able to capture that
1:59:21
information and we can dynamically adjust the binding curve to those external outputs or external input and
1:59:28
then we have this risk adjusted bonding curve so you have this bonding curve that essentially adapts itself to the
1:59:34
environment so let's see how we model this so what we did first so this is
1:59:41
some work that I did with my team at block science and what we're essentially doing is we're going to be modern
1:59:47
modeling the system and we we have done this in order to eventually write
1:59:53
simulations and build a CAD model as well as write experiments and make
1:59:58
simulations so that we can validate certain assumptions about our project so
2:00:04
what we did here the first step is to describe the system as a finite state
2:00:09
machine and so each face of this project is considered as a state in the system
2:00:15
and that state has a input and output as well as a state transition into the next
2:00:21
state and then the next thing that we did is that we had in this project it
2:00:28
was a very large space of different roles that were playing that were part of the system so this is a
2:00:34
social impact impact bond as a result of that there was tons of service providers
2:00:39
there were tons of participants and tons of people that had different roles right so what we did in order to deal with all
2:00:46
of those nuances is we classified all of them into different agent classes and
2:00:51
the way we classified them into agent classes is by classifying them based on
2:00:57
the kinds of mechanisms that they participate in as well as the kinds of actions they are allowed to take so then
2:01:03
we arrived at these four agent classes that are in these different colored circles here so the main ones that we
2:01:11
want to really be looking at here are traders as well as claiming dispute issuers as well as out compare players
2:01:19
so so what we did also was that since we
2:01:25
are we were able to classify all of the roles into agent classes with those
2:01:30
agent classes came certain operational requirements so operational requirements if you think of it as in this context is
2:01:37
basically just certain requirements that are imposed in the system which disallow
2:01:43
certain agents to partake in certain activities or do certain actions so that
2:01:48
so they define kind of the legal set or the legal set of flumazenil
2:01:53
commercial accent actions that an agent can take so as a result of that we
2:01:59
arrived at the action space so the action space is a much smaller space which consists of all of the permissible
2:02:06
actions that the agents can take and then the next thing that we did also was
2:02:12
this was a constrained the generalized fate in general state space as well and as a result of that we arrived at a much
2:02:20
smaller configuration space so now already by doing these two steps which is to constrain the action space as well
2:02:27
as constraining the general state state space we already have like decrease the dimensionality of a system by a lot and
2:02:34
now we have a much easier system to deal with so let's talk about the mechanisms
2:02:40
so in this particular system we have two and dropping mecha
2:02:45
in isms one of a banach herb and then the second of a prediction market so the bonding curve acts as a judicial bonding
2:02:52
curve and it has the two usual bonding curve functions which is that of
2:02:57
parchment and burn to a draw and these are the actions that any of the agents
2:03:03
can take and then the prediction market though has these two actions call a test
2:03:09
positive and a test negative which is basically the agent's way of saying whether a project or a bond would be
2:03:17
successful or not so when they attest positive they are basically voting in favor of the bond being successful and if they
2:03:24
attacks negative they believe that they basically are signaling that they
2:03:29
believe that the body may not be successful and so each of this is associated with a certain change in
2:03:36
where the supply tokens go so the supply tokens will either go to a bucket of s1
2:03:43
tokens so they get bonded to s1 which is the bucket of supply tokens that are dedicated to positive outstations or
2:03:49
they will go to s 0 and and then so we
2:03:55
have these two different mechanisms that are entropic operating with each other each other right so how do we introduce
2:04:02
the notion of invariance here so the way we do that is we discovered in that in
2:04:09
our system that the invariants are actually only invariant on one of these
2:04:15
mechanisms at a time so for example we have this V invariant which is only invariant on the bond to burn mechanism
2:04:21
but but the attestation mechanism so whenever an agent does an attestation action it would change V so it's not
2:04:28
conserved under the attestation mechanism and similarly in the attestation mechanism we have an
2:04:34
invariant I which doesn't get conserved on the bond and burn mechanism so
2:04:39
whenever an agent wants to bond or burn tokens die invariant will change so so
2:04:50
this is the nice thing about hybrid systems is that while they are independent mechanisms the bonding
2:04:56
corrupt mechanism as well as the prediction market mechanism there to operating with each other even though they are independent so the changes in
2:05:03
one mechanism can affect the state variables that will have a role in the
2:05:09
other mechanism as well so you can see that when a bonding curve or a bond
2:05:14
action is done then there will be no change in the invariant V or capo which is the curvature of the bonding curve
2:05:20
and then B is also conserved and then there's a change in all of these state
2:05:26
variables and so this is this entire side represents just a traditional bonding curve working and then this
2:05:33
entire side represents just the traditional prediction market working however when they drop interoperate with
2:05:39
each other then you can see that these are only the changes that they would induce on the other mechanism which is
2:05:47
really nice and simple and so now we can we are able to digest essentially how
2:05:53
two mechanisms can work with each other and so the crux of this project is
2:06:01
actually estimating risk and being able to utilize this risk parameter which is
2:06:06
called alpha in order to determine the payouts that the project will receive or
2:06:13
the agents will receive at the end of the project so alpha which is the rest parameter it determines the likelihood
2:06:20
of success of a bond and so we initialized it to some value let's say we English like just 0.5 right so 0.5
2:06:27
would indicate that the project was is equally likely to succeed or to fail and
2:06:32
then whenever an agent would attest positively that means they attached in favor of the project succeeding then the
2:06:40
alpha would increase and then whenever the agent would any other agent would it has negatively that means they believe
2:06:46
that the alpha their private alpha is actually lesser than the half of the
2:06:53
system then they the alpha of the system will go down a little bit so at the end
2:06:59
of the day we will we will at the end of the system we will arrive at in alpha which is the final alpha which will be a
2:07:06
compilation of all of the agent actions
2:07:12
so the game axes axes and estimator of alphas ultimately all the agents have a
2:07:19
private belief and this private belief whenever they do take an attestation action that action access signal for
2:07:27
their private alpha and then once we have that action which is the signal which is revealed to the system then we
2:07:33
will be able to use that in the estimator and then we can finally get a off estimate which access the system
2:07:39
alpha so that way we're able to get private information and make use of that private information to make an estimate
2:07:44
or an estimate of the system so we also
2:07:50
make an update on alpha so so if you remember the previous diagram that we
2:07:56
saw here how is alpha get in how does alpha get updated here and the way we do that is by using a Markov chain the
2:08:02
update process and a convex combination of the current alpha as well as the realized alpha and the way we do this is
2:08:08
because the way we use a Markov chain is because of the fact that we don't want
2:08:14
the Alpha to change so significantly just based on a single agents action and the reason why we use a convex
2:08:20
combination is so we can maintain that alpha between zero and one which is the domain of the Alpha that we have defined
2:08:26
so here we get the next state alpha based on the current state alpha as well
2:08:31
as the realized sulfur which is essentially the Alpha that on the agent gets when they are taking the attestation action so so then we arrive
2:08:40
at the update of the other and so this is how we account for risk in a short
2:08:46
sentence of the system and this is how we would get or get private information
2:08:56
and are able to use private information in order to make certain estimations
2:09:02
about system level state variables and with that I will take questions now and
2:09:09
you can also check out all of our work we have posted it on the blog site slash
2:09:15
interchange foundation and you can also reach out to me if you have any more questions offline if you would like and
2:09:21
yeah so see you Thank You Shirley that was awesome so
2:09:28
unfortunate we don't have time for questions right now but please do reach out to Shirley and all of that work that
2:09:34
you've just been describing is open source right so people can really check that out I think there was a lot of you dropped a lot of awesome stuff there I
2:09:41
think people need a little bit to digest that so that's all available on github is it yep it's available here on the
2:09:48
blog site slash interchain foundation so a lot of the work that I presented today does have to do with further
2:09:55
explorations that we have Donna and we will be posting that soon and but all of
2:10:01
the work that I presented on the formal part of the presentation thought it's all available on github link right here
2:10:06
and that will encompass all the engineering requirements and the system
2:10:11
requirements that we have done so far perfect thank you and with that we move
Case Study III: Alpha-Bonds, Dr. Shaun Conway
2:10:17
on to Sean Conway who is going to give the project context that implements a
2:10:24
typo new curve design sean is the co-founder is the founder of XO and he
2:10:30
started his career as a medical doctor actually it was involved in system design and data-driven responses to global health challenges and for the
2:10:38
last 10 years he's been on a mission to build a digital immune system for Humanity I had to read that because it's
2:10:45
so awesome Sean we're looking forward to your presentation fantastic thanks
2:10:53
thanks very much Jonathan so it's really great to be talking to you in the same
2:10:59
panelist people who have been building on these ideas for some years and I
2:11:04
remember meeting up with Simon in 2014 and working with with Paul over the past
2:11:13
couple of years and then finally sort of coming to this engineering work that's been done with block science it's really
2:11:19
a realization of some ideas that are really about how do we deal with complex
2:11:24
systems challenges and so what I'd like to talk about today is some really practical use case of these mechanisms
2:11:32
within the context of development finance and specifically to kind of talk
2:11:38
through how this overcomes some of the constraints of analog systems moving
2:11:43
into the digits as digitization of those systems and then kind of where we're going with what we can call cyber
2:11:52
physical systems and so hopefully this kind of puts into context everything
2:11:57
we've heard about tonight in in the context of real world complex systems
2:12:02
and what I'm going to talk about specifically is the implementation within the context of primary education
2:12:11
in India and so we have a project with we're doing together with UBS optimist
2:12:16
foundation and UBS Bank which is a four-year project to do research and
2:12:21
development around how to really change the game in terms of development finance
2:12:27
for social impact and and an environmental impact as well so when
2:12:34
they're looking at this from a systems perspective we're really trying to
2:12:40
achieve some system level goals and so I call this kind of seeking alpha essentially we're trying to reduce these
2:12:46
risks that systems have and in reducing the risks we're trying to increase the
2:12:52
impacts that can be achieved the capital returns that can be realized by investors and in increasing the positive
2:12:59
externalities whilst ensuring that the negative externalities are decreased and making sure that the projects actually
2:13:05
get implemented so in these kind of five system level goals are generic but if we
2:13:11
look at them in the context of this education initiative the impacts specifically that the development impact
2:13:18
bond that's currently underway is looking to have is to improve the literacy and numeracy of these two
2:13:25
hundred thousand school children so this is currently funded and currently implemented it's a drop in the ocean
2:13:31
compared to a huge need to transform educational needs and and quality
2:13:38
education within a country like India the second part of this is that in this
2:13:44
are putting in capital and want to get some capital returns back on this and want to do it in a way that their
2:13:50
capital is preserved and is reduced so we want to kind of create this promise of something like a 10%
2:13:56
annual rate of return the positive externalities in this is that the system
2:14:02
should strengthen the educational system overall it shouldn't just be an initiative which is narrowly focused and
2:14:09
and that just kind of funds a few people to do a few things this should actually contribute to system strengthening and I
2:14:17
need to somehow reduce my constant see my screen properly but um okay so it
2:14:24
needs to also decrease the negative externalities such as the dependency that we often see with these kind of
2:14:29
financing initiatives on an external agency so we want to bring about much much greater autonomy and ability to for
2:14:37
people to take care of themselves and then finally not having dropouts from
2:14:42
from the program so this is how a results-based finance mechanism works in
2:14:51
a traditional finance context I mean really these are some very generic concepts their risk investors would
2:14:57
induce introduce the capital which is working capital that gets utilized by the service providers but with some
2:15:04
promise that the outputs of the service providers or actually the outcomes so
2:15:09
the impacts are going to be achieved will be purchased or funded by some outcomes funders and our companies can
2:15:16
be government's there can be development finance institutions they can be sort of
2:15:21
really any any anyone is interested in the results of what's going to be funded
2:15:26
and in this process in order to to repay
2:15:32
the investors there's an independent evaluation process and that will in
2:15:37
verify whether these outcomes have been met and if they have their triggers
2:15:42
repayments and if it doesn't then it triggers losses so in a traditional
2:15:48
finance sense there's a configuration that needs to happen you need to set up
2:15:54
this instrument you need to set up the projects and you need to issue the bonds
2:15:59
as an instrument and so you know the alarm of the challenges that you have in
2:16:05
this initializer and actually not uncommon to the challenges that we have even if we're
2:16:10
trying to do this kind of new economy crypto economic sort of sense but
2:16:17
specifically in traditional finance we've got a problem that you need to form all the capital of France so you're
2:16:24
going to implement this project educating two hundred thousand schoolchildren over for over four years
2:16:29
you need tens of millions of dollars and you're not going to start their project until you actually got the capital model
2:16:34
which means convincing investors that they should invest and that means
2:16:40
finding like-minded investors with similar tolerance to risk and so on and so you kind of have this startup kind of
2:16:46
problem also you're trying to estimate the risk so the cost of capital upfront
2:16:52
ex-ante which is really just it's a bit of a joke I mean most of these these projects and programs are completely
2:16:59
unpredictable they're all startups and so trying to estimate what the capital is going to cost and factor in risk and
2:17:05
ex-ante is is really just a joke and then there's the whole process of commissioning the services contracting
2:17:11
counterparties how do you calculate these outcomes what's the methodologies etc and then somebody has to carry the
2:17:18
overhead of this whole system and so whilst these results based financing mechanisms are are kind of sexy in their
2:17:25
sort of ideology in their practical implementation that actually really difficult to do and this development
2:17:31
impact one for education in India is the last one that's been done for for a social a social impact program and it's
2:17:40
taking years to design in US and it's complicated and maybe too big to fail at sort and so in these systems we tend to
2:17:48
find that the information flows to the systems and even the financing mechanisms of what I kind of would call
2:17:56
analog and there that means they're low definition you know I think of kind of analog televisions and you know the all
2:18:04
kind of quaint stuff that we grew up with and so the data is is low
2:18:09
resolution and I'll explain a little bit I think it'll become clear as I come through this it's low fidelity so on the
2:18:16
right hand side you've got a picture of some dots and a grid so imagine this is two hundred thousand schoolchildren over three
2:18:23
states in India hundreds of schools many of them very remote and so really
2:18:29
collecting information and trying to resolve their information to understand what's going on to understand what their
2:18:34
risks are is extremely challenging and so generally the the system is information cooler because of the way
2:18:40
that the information is collected and because this information Hoover and the risks are quite realistic unquantified
2:18:46
and often that kind of the information that's coming through is not really well correlated with reality and so you know
2:18:53
I've been out there into into some of these these project sites this is just west west daily and yeah the children
2:19:01
are completing some independent assessment exams which is the basis on
2:19:07
which they get evaluates before whether they improve their education or not and this is this is really analog and low
2:19:15
definition and so what the project does is a collector you have a baseline measurement using those methods
2:19:21
paper-based tests and so on and then this follow-up sort of at the end of each year and so in the year one you get
2:19:29
this average which was based on randomised sampling and very sparse data and so it's it's it's kind of an
2:19:37
impression that yes this has improved it costs a lot of money to actually get this information because you're sending
2:19:43
people are to go and invigilator exams and so on and then collecting papers and flipping them or flying them or to
2:19:49
somewhere where they will get input in and so on and so this is not really not
2:19:55
really a sort of very valuable exercise but it's the whole basis for this results based financing and so what
2:20:02
we've looked at to improve this to improve the effectiveness and the
2:20:08
efficiency is to bring in digital innovation so improve the resolution improve the fidelity collect more
2:20:15
information so it's more rich you're able to then quantify the risks and you have a much greater
2:20:20
correlation with reality and on the right-hand side that you've got a data graph so you've got linked data you you
2:20:28
can you collect the data in the right kind of ways and so with it so we've been working on calls are on what I call high-definition
2:20:36
data so this is using using linked data using semantic web and using verifiable
2:20:45
credentials which hash the data you can timestamp but put it into sequential
2:20:51
graphs and everything is signed and you know so there's a lot of fidelity and there's a lot of resolution because of
2:20:58
the resolution Iran identifiers and so on so they are protocols beta protocols that enable us to get this really really
2:21:04
much higher definition data and so here in the same school is what we did was we gave the children tablets and captured
2:21:13
the data directly on the tablets and the whole mechanism of roundest enables for much greater data collection much more
2:21:20
accurate much more high fidelity and you can bring in all kinds of designs in
2:21:25
terms of like good calm survey practices around reducing attack vectors and so on
2:21:31
you know it's like randomizing that the test questions and putting Bruce are the
2:21:38
limitation limitations on this so that you don't get cheating and you don't get you don't get gaming of the system and
2:21:44
so feeding this into you know interested into a blockchain based platform we can
2:21:50
now create the stateful data which creates these records over time which
2:21:55
enables us to now build the economy on top of that and build mechanisms on top of that and I think that this is like a
2:22:01
really key concept in mechanism design in crypto economics and in bonding
2:22:08
curves is that if you can build these systems on stateful data you're able to build economy that is able to represent
2:22:16
a state of what is today the state of the world and then incentivize the achievements of future States and this
2:22:22
is particularly important in the sustainable development and and kind of impacts use cases and so now you know
2:22:31
this is really conceptual but now we can really kind of get a high definition full-color picture because we're able to
2:22:40
collect data right down at the individual level so individual children we're able to get everybody to be tested
2:22:46
and able to feed that in using you know using good data and using digital
2:22:52
signals and we can feed that in to now create an integral measure of what what
2:23:00
has happened over the year rather than just some sort of abstracted average so
2:23:06
in terms of signal process in the next level on this is that we're implementing
2:23:11
a pilot together with an NGO called simple and they've developed tablet
2:23:18
based learning tools which collect data as the children are interacting with a
2:23:24
tool and as they're learning they're achieving different levels of achievement and so that is sending
2:23:30
through the information and so now we've got the prospect to collect data real-time which feeds into our
2:23:37
understanding of how this is progressing towards those future states so the children want to get to a point of
2:23:44
provable literacy and numeracy and along the way we can see the levels of the
2:23:50
game that they're kind of getting to and that's providing us with a signal that can come into the system now how we link
2:23:56
the signal to the financing is where the bonding curves come in I just want to
2:24:02
make a mention here of the value that gets created when we put in place these kind of systems that are data rich and
2:24:10
that are incentivized and so I like this kind of kind of rule of thumb thing here
2:24:18
key functions you know so when we start to have good data that we can perform
2:24:24
operations on we can use functionally we're able to not only just prove that
2:24:29
the claims are true or not but we can also use this to make predictions and so
2:24:35
this alpha is a good example of the prediction so we can predict the risk we can predict whether this program is
2:24:42
actually going to produce the results that we wanted to achieve and that prediction can happen at the level of
2:24:47
the system is this all going to meet the
2:24:53
grades and so on if not how do we create an information feedback loop which personalizes the curricula
2:25:00
whilst ensuring that you have like a protection against privacy infringement
2:25:06
and whole range of other sort of threats that might might occur and you can
2:25:12
proactively then use the data to prevent learning risks you know such as the risk of failure and so on and prescribe
2:25:20
specific measures such as remedial support and so this is obviously all in the context of this educational program
2:25:25
but it's generalizable to any system that is built on good data so now the
2:25:33
third sort of evolution in these systems designs is cyber-physical systems so
2:25:42
we're moving from from analog to digital to cyber physical so from low definition
2:25:47
to high-definition to decide to digital twins okay and so here we've got not
2:25:55
only the sort of resolution of the data but also how that data gets fed into a live system that provides feedback loops
2:26:01
which enables us to make decisions adapt and so on and we can then utilize that
2:26:08
feedback to do trusted execution so in a sort of robotics engineering kind of
2:26:13
analogy we can put in place controllers which ensure that you know you can only
2:26:18
operate within certain parameters safe and as this information feeds through it
2:26:26
builds intelligence in the system more data creates more intelligence and if we use the data with machine learning where
2:26:32
we also bring human inputs into this as truly was mentioning bringing private
2:26:38
beliefs in for instance this enables us to become much more intelligent and then we can attenuate the risks by this
2:26:45
sensing and responding speed of mechanisms and this much more merges
2:26:52
with reality compared to that abstraction that we see with you know going out and handing out some test
2:26:58
papers and getting the children's few children to answer test results we're now we're really emerging reality with
2:27:03
humans in the new liver and economy and so the economy in the new part which is
2:27:08
where it's burning purpose you know firstly I I think really in an exciting way
2:27:15
implements this principle that prices incorporate a whole lot of information
2:27:22
that we can't even necessarily measure so we've got a private beliefs we've got various data feeds and so on but
2:27:28
ultimately priced according to Friedrich Hayek you know it gives us this
2:27:34
communication of information that is more than the sum of the parts in a
2:27:40
sense and then an end to quote the doctors I go you know and then we get
2:27:47
into economic games as estimators so we've got Christ but we also got like a gaming on that price we've got an
2:27:53
interaction with that price and so now we started to get a lot more information all right so we looked at the
2:27:59
configuration space from a traditional finance or conventional impact bond
2:28:04
perspective now we've got a crypto economic design so again a configuration
2:28:10
space and so within that that space we can say right this is the space that we're going to design and play the game
2:28:17
in and this is a state space okay so we are able to build on stateful changes
2:28:26
and records over time and we're able to do that through both the states and also
2:28:36
a space that that state occupies and so when we talk about space you know for
2:28:42
instance physical space here so what is the budget what what are the financing parameters here then what is the
2:28:49
economic space how do we interact with those financial flows and the capital is
2:28:54
available and so on so what are the economic mechanisms or game mechanisms and then how do we generate that state
2:29:02
so what are the claims that are required in order to go from one state to the next and how do we drive those state
2:29:10
changes towards a future state which is
2:29:15
has achieved what it was meant to achieve so an alpha of one defining an
2:29:22
attainable future stated and then making everything work so that we can get there and in the process of getting there we
2:29:28
need to have state transitions so what triggers those payments are when alpha is achieved outcomes payment is paid so
2:29:35
we need to have some conditions and mechanisms for state transitions to happen and then ultimately how does this
2:29:41
play into a bigger economy in terms of being able to leverage capital markets
2:29:47
and play into new kinds of markets well we need to have ways of transferring
2:29:52
information about economic value and tokenized outcomes are a really great way of doing this you know so yes yeah
2:30:00
we're kind of figuring out our best guess of the curve and generally to
2:30:05
demystify this if you ask anybody what's your project and and look like said well the probably starts up a little bit slow
2:30:10
and then we pick up and we we do quite well and then towards the ends a little bit difficult to kind of finishing
2:30:15
everything off and so there's this s-shaped curve with a bit of hand waving is pretty much what everyone would say
2:30:22
the project looks like and so that we can get some reference ideas around what
2:30:27
to expect and then we can measure against that expected and then we can configure things like the outcomes
2:30:33
payment so we can say well outcomes pay we'll pay back all the costs plus a coupon value that says 10 percent so we
2:30:40
can configure all of this into the system and then we can start to play the game so this is my attempt to just try
2:30:47
and represent what the game might look like this is in anticipation of the nice
2:30:54
CAD CAD models that block science is busy building which will have fantastic visualizations in evidence so you know
2:31:01
so we've got the idea here you started this alpha of 0.5 50-50 chance that this party is gonna fail or succeed and
2:31:09
investment comes in in the background didn't animate this but in the background you've got claims coming in
2:31:15
and you've got verifications happening and so if I'm building up towards the outcome which is children becoming
2:31:23
numerous becoming literate and so more money comes in into the into the bonding
2:31:29
curve and the Alpha is changing but maybe something happens in the in the
2:31:34
course of this project we offer suddenly dips down so our signals that are coming
2:31:39
and say what alpha is actually not has gone down because this project seems to
2:31:44
be hitting a bit of a city patch and it's gonna not maybe not achieve its its
2:31:49
outcomes and so now you've got some investors we say okay we're actually going to move our position we we're
2:31:55
going to move into the predicting that maybe this projects not going to work and so they they they move their stake
2:32:04
from in the prediction market from yes this project is going to succeed so they
2:32:10
know this projects not gonna succeed and so we go on and offer the project gets
2:32:16
back on course alpha increases and we get to a point where alpha hits one and so the payoffs happens and and so now we
2:32:25
have the stakeholders in the project getting there they're getting their
2:32:30
returns how do we interface this with people in who aren't interested in
2:32:39
bonding verbs and we just want to put money into a project and make sure that it's a money back and the project does
2:32:45
good well this is all in the interface design and really what we've implemented here is is something that is looks
2:32:54
pretty much like traditional fights this doesn't look like an impact bond you don't really know about impact bonds and so on you seem to know that you know
2:33:00
you're taking a share in the bond you've got an investment you can withdraw it is returns etc and what's really exciting
2:33:08
about these mechanisms is hardly potentially enable a different set of
2:33:17
dynamics around stake holding so these dynamics are both about humans in the loop you know so I can explain this in a
2:33:25
way that when I went up to the project in India and it's a results-based
2:33:30
project and I spoke to agents on the ground so that people who are actually educating the children I said you're
2:33:36
part of this impact bonds project and this has got some incentives in it so if
2:33:41
you guys do well that everyone gets paid out and they said we really have no clue what those incentives are we're just
2:33:47
told by a head office that we need to do a good job I go to head office and ask head office kind of what's the
2:33:53
what's the incentives and listen I said well yes somewhere in a big contract that citizens of finance director's
2:34:00
office and so this is really not humans in the loop audit of that mechanism so
2:34:06
how do we bring everyone into this picture so just as Griffis was
2:34:12
mentioning in this presentation you can for instance implement a mechanism where people get paid in bond tokens so they
2:34:20
can either choose to take the bond tokens or maybe depending on how you set it up you could actually make that a
2:34:26
condition of their implementation of this mechanism so that you need to be paid in the bond tokens which means
2:34:33
you've got a stake in the outcome by having a tokenized mechanism and having
2:34:38
this kind of bonding killer mechanism which is continuous and which allows for people to come in anywhere along
2:34:44
wherever they feel comfortable in terms of their risk appreciation and also in
2:34:50
terms of like what they can afford and when they can come in we we create the
2:34:57
potential that everyone can get States into the game everyone is then incentivized to achieve the future state
2:35:03
and everyone is participating both to the formation of the Capitol as well as
2:35:09
the allocation of the Capitol and linking these kinds of mechanisms to to governance mechanisms helps that process
2:35:17
as well so if you actually go to stake you can then you can then participate in boat and governor's proposal and so on
2:35:23
this really does change the game and so we can almost envisage this as being a
2:35:28
decentralized investment committee that is making decisions about about projects
2:35:35
and ensuring that they succeed so I
2:35:41
found apologies to interrupt are we gonna move on to the next session is there any way you can wrap this up in one or two slides and tell people where
2:35:48
they can deep dive Thanks I think I
2:35:53
think in terms of like the bottom line is if you wanted to really have scale how do you implement a thousand of these
2:36:00
impact bonds by these alpha bonds the answer is you don't you let them implement themselves so this is
2:36:07
really about creating autonomous replicable mechanisms that are properly
2:36:14
designed in engineered and this is why the work that block science is doing is so important so that they can operate on
2:36:21
the world and people can actually set up their own bonds for their own educational projects for instance so
2:36:28
schools can actually set up their own bonds and and implement that and that's really the end of this other than to say
2:36:34
the applicability is really generalizable we've got the sustainable development goals the 1770s so guiding
2:36:43
framework in terms of like the scope of what's needed but we can apply this debt
2:36:49
based financing mechanism to really any use case and so ways to look for more
2:36:57
information you can contact me on this email address or foundation and yeah
2:37:06
there's a lot of resources available to kind of read about this and learn more
2:37:15
thank you Shawn so we are at the last session and I'm
Token Bonding Curves in Scientific Research, Dr. Michael Zargham
2:37:21
very happy to announce that dr. Zaire has joined us so it feels a little bit
2:37:27
like introducing a family member to the family because we kind of all know each other here so doctors areum holds a PhD
2:37:35
in systems engineering and he's he's worked at the University of Pennsylvania on optimization and control he's the
2:37:42
founder of black science but he's also invented the cathead library that that we've talked about in many of these talks he's been in one way or the other
2:37:49
involved in most of the projects that we've talked about today so in essence we could talk a lot about a lot of
2:37:55
things with him today why I thought the session at the end would be exciting though is because block science in
2:38:02
doctors arugam work really at the intersection between sort of pure
2:38:07
theoretical science and you know if you will for me like Crypt economist gives more to scientific side and then token
2:38:13
engineering is kind of the applied science side and block signs and this is right in the middle so I'm
2:38:20
looking forward for four perspectives on on how the scientific world sees not
2:38:25
only cryptic or non-existence in general but especially those using talking barnacles looking forwards or them often
2:38:34
well thank you very much for having me I am going to share my desktop and then
2:38:40
I am going to go to play mode maybe go
2:38:46
to the beginning instead of the end of my talk quick reverse free of you for
2:38:52
the things I want to talk about okay so I'm gonna talk about bonding curves configuration spaces and estimators a
2:38:59
lot of these concepts have come up in the various applications but I'm also going to start with talking about how
2:39:04
this relates to the sort of academic versus the applied the application of
2:39:09
these theories as Jonathan mentioned so I'm gonna start with a quick note on so my PhD was at Penn in technically in a
2:39:18
robotics lab and I worked on basically this kind of decentralized is optimization in over sort of private
2:39:25
decision makers with private information type problems as a family of mathematical problems called like
2:39:32
essentially distributed optimization but in the formal sense if you look at the mathematics of it the individual agents
2:39:40
are local and they have local information and the Coordination task is the essence of the optimization problem
2:39:45
and I was a member of the of the group of ology ba-bye who's a the director of
2:39:51
socio technical systems at MIT now and you can see from I grabbed his page I'll show you this is the area of academia
2:39:57
that I come from and in particular I'm here on the group alumni site and here's a link to what my dissertation was and
2:40:04
what you'll notice is that despite the fact that these concepts have a lot in
2:40:09
common with sort of crypto economics there's zero crypto in this field like if you were to go through you'd learn
2:40:15
about learning in games and you'd look at different types of privacy-preserving
2:40:21
computation and all sorts of cool stuff that's going on but there's like almost a complete absence of the sort of crypto
2:40:29
economic thinking but there's a ton of overlaps in terms of the mathematical methods and there's a long history of complex systems
2:40:37
cybernetics multi-agent control that one could dive into and you often hear me
2:40:42
talking about these things I'm not gonna try to give a survey of all all of that today I'm gonna focus on bonding curves
2:40:48
but just to give you a little like precedence this is sort of how I got here and it wasn't really through crypto
2:40:53
um what's really interesting about this though is these are people and this is a field that's drawn heavily on robotics
2:41:00
and as a result has a very real application flavor it's not about theorizing about what an
2:41:07
economy might do it's about actually understanding the way decisions and estimates actually emerge in systems of
2:41:15
many agents and so I tend to fall immediately back on this particular subset which is cyber physical systems
2:41:21
and again many of these topics were referred to but in particular I like to highlight the definition a cyber
2:41:27
physical system is a mechanism that is controlled or monitored by computer based algorithms tightly integrated with
2:41:34
the internet and its users and and all of this concept was coined relatively recently the actual application of it
2:41:41
the making of such things actually extends further into the past basically from the beginning of networking not
2:41:50
even just the internet with the ability to sort of network computer systems we started creating computer systems that
2:41:56
webbed things together that included the capacity for human inputs human
2:42:01
oversight or even human behavior being monitored we have this sort of great
2:42:08
material from Berkeley that I always recommend people check out as a sort of foundation of applied complex systems
2:42:15
engineering and then we can talk specifically about economics and the
2:42:20
field of economics is broadly the study of coordination processes of both human
2:42:26
and in this case now machine decision-making about how to allocate resources and ultimately there's not one
2:42:33
concrete definition of economics in even the economics literature so I cited a
2:42:38
paper here that actually goes on an overview of all the different ways that economics is defined and
2:42:44
sort of various similarities and differences and for our part I think we
2:42:49
can focus predominantly on the relationship between systems and agents and for systems we often look at the
2:42:55
institutional economics in the way that we think about these higher-order combinations of behavior and the
2:43:01
structures of decision-making result in sort of entity level behaviors or entity
2:43:07
level properties and we're generally refer to this as system level but this is interrelated with the individual
2:43:13
decision-making processes and the individual beliefs and that the way that agents work and if you look at the
2:43:19
historical literature on computational social systems computational social science you'll see a sort of bifurcation
2:43:25
between a very system centric view which comes from the sort of forest or
2:43:31
tradition and a very agent centric view which is the sort of ABM models that are very popular now and what we find is
2:43:37
that in practice we actually need both of these things to reason effectively about these systems because there's
2:43:44
actual feedback between scales and so this particular diagram is a
2:43:49
interpretation of a concept that's expressed in a paper called micro meso
2:43:55
macro of which one of the authors is Jason Potts who's very active in the
2:44:00
sort of institutional economics of crypto he's at RMIT and I think that
2:44:05
really important the fact here is that we design some policies or some algorithms or decision-making rules that
2:44:13
actually just give agents the set of actions they're allowed to take much like Shruti discussed earlier and that
2:44:19
then agents make their own choices based on their own private signals about what to do but the system level state sort of
2:44:27
emerges from all those individual behaviors interactions between agents and each other interactions between
2:44:33
agents and the sort of perceived state of the system they can see either directly or indirectly the sort of
2:44:40
nature of the system they're participating in and that will influence their decision so we can't just have the
2:44:45
system level view and we can't just have the agent level view and in fact our algorithmic policy sort of design space
2:44:53
is really related to pasting these two things too and it's quite non-trivial I recently
2:45:01
tweeted that algorithmic policy is everything you don't understand about machine decision-making combined with
2:45:07
everything you don't understand about human decision-making and I think that that really holds true and that our job
2:45:13
in both crypto economics and token engineering is to both improve our understanding and then build things that
2:45:20
leverage that understanding to help sort of people at you to achieve ends you
2:45:25
know that are for themselves maybe not so much for for the system or you could say that the system's behavior is you
2:45:33
know something that's being kind of Co steered with the people rather than the system imposing on people and in fact
2:45:41
the bonding curve is an example of a price discovery mechanism that helps us sort of the bonding curve doesn't set
2:45:48
the price the bonding curve gives us rules about how the price is discovered
2:45:53
as a function of the decisions of the individual agents and this is a broad concept that I think really can be
2:46:00
refined in the network science literature in particular this sort of economics cross complexity science topic
2:46:08
where we're really looking at the way individual agents express their decisions and the way that the system's
2:46:15
sort of aggregate that into system level properties and again if you think in the
2:46:21
agent-based modeling framework what you're talking about is the patterns that emerge from a set of local rules
2:46:26
but these individual decisions aren't in a completely blue ocean or green field
2:46:33
environment they're actually they're acting on something with some fundamental process models whether it's
2:46:39
no double spends or whether it's the bonding curve invariant something about
2:46:44
the algorithmic policy or rules that restricts the space of actions that you
2:46:49
can take and defines the consequences of those actions is actually channeling the
2:46:54
information from the individuals into this sort of system level behavior so what we really want to do is understand
2:47:01
how to take these theoretical models of complex systems and the real data and the real decisions of real individuals
2:47:08
infuse them into a practical system that helps 'chief like you know some desired
2:47:14
outcomes and sometimes desired the outcome itself is very tricky because in a decentralized system there isn't
2:47:20
necessarily a unique global utility function that we can optimize for but
2:47:26
rather we have to abstract it some and say you know everyone has their own you know wants and needs and preferences and
2:47:32
signals and if everyone acts according to their own sort of private sub
2:47:38
gradient descent what can we say about the trajectory or the direction of the the system as a whole and for that we
2:47:46
actually like at least I rely heavily on analogies to to robotics and in
2:47:51
particular because they give us nice formal mathematical structures like this thing the configuration space for the
2:47:58
set of things that can happen not the set of things that will happen but rather the set of things that can happen
2:48:04
and and this is super interesting in the case of a multi agent system because the
2:48:11
multi-agent system has this property that everybody's doing stuff and it's
2:48:16
all legal stuff but whether or not you actually get the intended outcome is in
2:48:21
the sense of a specific trajectory is really unclear and so in this arm example we can imagine that this arm has
2:48:28
a set of configurations that can take so it can't violate the sort of lengths of the lever arms or the angles where it
2:48:34
can bend but actually it can do all sorts of different movements and if I
2:48:39
gave you a controller to control it and you were the only one controlling it you can probably get the hang of using it to
2:48:45
do stuff like you know pick something up move it take a marble and put it in a bucket or generally you know do stuff
2:48:51
now the real challenge arises when I give everyone on the call a controller
2:48:56
to the same robot the set of things and forms the robot can take is still restricted by the robot itself but it's
2:49:04
probably at least initially gonna flail around because you're taking actions based on your observations of the arm
2:49:10
and seeing where it is thinking about where you want it to go and then moving it according to you know your controller
2:49:17
which allows you to say you know bend it in a certain way but if everyone's doing this at the same time it's really
2:49:24
unclear what kind of pad is going to emerge and in fact in a way accomplishing something meaningful could
2:49:30
be done by functionally colluding to sort of agree external to the system to
2:49:35
do something that we want to do or maybe it's just that we all do our own thing and the system is actually capable of
2:49:42
sort of averaging that out into something meaningful and this is kind of what we hope for with the price
2:49:47
discovery mechanisms and also what we hope for with the sort of alpha discovery mechanisms where we're not
2:49:52
even making the assumption that people collude we're making the assumption that people do things based on their own
2:49:58
private signals preferences etc and that the system has retained some critical
2:50:03
properties for all sequences of actions regardless of whether collusion was in place regardless of what the underlying
2:50:10
incentive that drove the action was we're still mixing or fusing all of those individual signals into an
2:50:17
aggregate system state which is still guaranteed to be in the configuration space so as long as the most important
2:50:24
properties of the system are characterized in terms of the configuration space we do have some sort
2:50:30
of first order safety properties and for the robotic arm example one interesting fact is that you know medical robots
2:50:36
often have physical restrictions on certain types of movements that are you know beyond just what the software can
2:50:43
can or can't do that it will actually physically be unable to do certain things in an effort to make those safer
2:50:49
even in the case where the software has some sort of malfunction or issue sort
2:50:55
of moving on this is our formal characterization of the configuration
2:51:00
space of the bonding curve and I'm not going to read you this whole thing the papers available this is part of my
2:51:07
ongoing academic work with the vaiue and the interdisciplinary research institute
2:51:13
for crypto economics where we're really trying to take these robotics formalisms and sort of show that the bonding curves
2:51:20
are actually an instance of this kind of thing they're not we're not saying that
2:51:26
bonding curves are the only configuration spaces but they work in a
2:51:31
large part because they can be described using configuration spaces and that the properties that we really care about in
2:51:38
our real system our manifest in these configuration spaces so if we want to learn from the
2:51:44
mechanisms that we have designed and that are starting to work in practice what about them made them work and how
2:51:50
do we make other things or how do we combine them into multiple mechanisms working together and retain some of the
2:51:58
properties that the individual parts had this is where we would use these concepts in robotics and systems
2:52:04
engineering to define state spaces and configuration spaces and look at what is
2:52:09
preserved under what conditions and actually take that into our into our design and into our testing
2:52:15
methodologies so what you can see here is we've highlighted the relationship between the system level state and the
2:52:21
agent level state and the way in which these enforcing rules reduce the system
2:52:27
space to a lower dimensional than the sort of raw dimension of the total
2:52:33
number of states through these equality restrictions visually this is generally presented in various forms of plot but
2:52:40
ultimately what you're seeing is a line that's a one dimension in a 2d space or
2:52:46
you know another characterization might look at it as a 2d thing in a 3d space
2:52:52
where we're talking or in a 4d space where we're talking about the each the supply of the reserved but also the
2:53:00
ratio of the supply to the reserved and also you know the sort of areas under
2:53:05
these things so you can think of the tangent if this as one augmented state and maybe the area under inaction is
2:53:12
another kind of augmented state it does depend a little bit on how you want to represent it and what concepts you're
2:53:18
dealing with but the fundamental degrees of freedom in the system are actually only one you're moving along a line and
2:53:25
when you start to compose with other mechanisms you add more degrees of freedom this same system actually the
2:53:32
same one degree of freedom at the system level can be manifest at the agent level when you go to take an action so the
2:53:39
relationship between these two curves are the way this system level state mutates when an action is taken versus
2:53:46
the way an agent's level State mutates when they take an action and these are just different perspectives on the same
2:53:52
action one from the impact on the system States and one from the impact on the agents
2:53:58
States and by building the relationship between those two things we can take a very signal processing like view of this
2:54:06
estimation process so if there's some private signals and agents are taking
2:54:11
action according to their own sort of local optimization problems or even just intuitively acting and we interpret that
2:54:19
as you know having some preference or signal behind it we can look at the way
2:54:25
that this signal is aggregated through the process of transacting on a bonding
2:54:30
curve in the economic games as estimators paper is an example of how this could be applied in the context of
2:54:37
a bonding curve specifically but again this concept of estimating through through observing the actions of agents
2:54:45
that are modulated by a set of algorithmic policies is far more general than just price estimators with bonding
2:54:51
curves and can include things like the Alpha estimator which is a in the family of prediction markets you can think of
2:54:57
it like estimating the odds but what's very interesting about Trudy's work here is that we're not just looking at
2:55:04
someone placing a bet we're actually looking at economic incentives that account for the way in which the odds
2:55:11
are updated by that bet so it's a bit like your bookie updating the odds in real time after every bet to preserve a
2:55:19
sort of in indifference invariant that says every bet results in a new set of
2:55:24
odds that make the next bet essentially a wash if you believe the odds are right
2:55:30
and that kind of feedback loop is the same kind of feedback that's present in this price estimator and it's the kind
2:55:37
of thing that we want to bring more generally into the idea of how do we gather information from individual
2:55:44
actors we do it through invariance function variant functions and by embedding the preservation of those
2:55:50
invariants inside the the policies or the economic mechanisms at play so in
2:55:56
the case of economic games as estimators paper I wrote with Chris Baruch and some
2:56:02
sheets reesh um we did some CAD CAD modeling to sort of show how this sort of track
2:56:07
property or price estimation could resolve in with a random sort of marking Gale dynamic so like basically random
2:56:14
sequence of price preferences on agents and the way the spot price can actually sort of track that that over time and
2:56:22
this is sort of going to hold true regardless of what we said as the sequence of price dynamics so we're
2:56:29
doing a sort of tracking or estimation problem demonstration and sort of show that these actually very rich and
2:56:35
long-standing techniques in signal processing and optimization and dynamic optimization actually do stand up to the
2:56:43
sort of hey we don't know what people think and why they think it they just do stuff we really want to treat those
2:56:48
people as expressing information rather than judging them as being rational or
2:56:55
irrational as the result of their actions deviation from our expectations
2:57:00
so I'm going to probably try to wrap up but first I wanted to make a comment
2:57:05
about what happens when there's more than one mechanism or more than one degree of freedom and most of you are
2:57:11
familiar with the unit swap application and I think that it's a really good example of a sort of very basic multi
2:57:20
mechanism scenario because the ability to swap versus the ability to add or
2:57:25
remove liquidity are actually two different mechanisms they each are one-dimensional movements in the case of
2:57:32
the adder room of liquidity you're you're sort of one dimension is the sort of area of the square the invariant this
2:57:39
product of x1 and x2 and you're really forced to add or remove liquidity in no
2:57:47
way that matches the current ratio so this angle is preserved so you're making the Box bigger or smaller depending on
2:57:53
whether you're removing liquidity or adding liquidity but you are restricted to this diagonal line as in the left
2:57:59
diagram whereas if you want to swap you're actually preserving the area but you're changing the angle and what's
2:58:07
really interesting about this to me is that it has a lot of like very similar
2:58:12
feel mathematically to the the idealized robot which is called a unicycle and a
2:58:18
unicycle is basically a little model of a of a point that can turn so it sort of
2:58:25
has it faces a certain direction so it has a direction and it has an ability to change direction so the angle changes or
2:58:33
it sort of accelerates or decelerates forward and backwards and this is a very primitive representation of a set of
2:58:40
admissible actions for moving a robot around a 2-dimensional space and you tend to learn how to control and manage
2:58:47
it as part of a mechatronics or robotics intro class and the fact that the unis
2:58:53
whap actually has very symbol or like sort of angular plus sort of forward-backward sort of mathematical
2:59:00
relation actually really highlights the way that uh you know an idealized market
2:59:05
could be used to start to reason better about maybe a much larger family of markets then aren't necessarily
2:59:11
implemented as you know swaps right it's an idealized market and in fact here I've even removed the fees which we know
2:59:18
would result in changes in the area when we would move along the swap so it would
2:59:23
be a slightly richer coupling because a swap on the right side mechanism will actually still increment the area
2:59:31
slightly because of the small fee is baked into an instance of you know swap and and the value of those fees
2:59:37
functionally accrues to the pool token holders precisely because they have a right to do withdraws or against that
2:59:46
pool or to burn those pool tokens I'm gonna kind of leave this be I think this
2:59:51
is a really important research vector and it's kind of continuing as we generalize these concepts of
2:59:57
configuration spaces and look at what it means to combine multiple mechanisms and
3:00:03
I will show you this video that Marcus made that was referenced a few times this shows real historical data using a
3:00:10
unis whopped CAD CAD model and again we can sort of see the fact that this mathematical model is not just a purely
3:00:16
theoretical or conceptual for the purpose of you know reasoning about it
3:00:22
you can actually use it to look at real data think about real data you can use
3:00:27
it to inform things like Hallman filters because it provides laws of motion definitely recommend people who are
3:00:33
interested in the Act overlap and applicable highly applicable heavily used algorithms look at at calm
3:00:40
and filters and particle filters the sort of sign-off point here is that this
3:00:47
opens up this research literature around path planning composed games are like
3:00:53
games that are made up of many many mechanisms with overlapping States so for example you use a group of liquidity
3:01:00
pools as a price Oracle for some sort of CDP provider and suddenly there's an
3:01:06
incentive to do a path through the graph of contracts you might say I'll go over here and I might do a swap or a bond
3:01:14
move the price on an Oracle then I might go somewhere else and take advantage of
3:01:20
the fact that that Oracle is providing information that's informing a decision
3:01:25
of say the requirements on a CDP and then I might go back and then swap my
3:01:32
tokens back or return the state of the previous system and this is a bit like a path planning problem where you take
3:01:38
three steps to the left go around an obstacle and takes three steps to the right you did something and undid it in
3:01:45
order to make it to accomplish some other goal that wasn't possible without the other mechanism and so you know very
3:01:52
simple introduction to path planning would be to look at Dijkstra's algorithm this is just a Wikipedia article and you
3:01:58
look at the way that sort of you know optimal paths are found through graphs but what I really want to point out is
3:02:04
that most of what we're seeing in defy when it comes to exploits that are not really hacks they're they're more like
3:02:10
using multiple mechanisms and complex patterns are really like the solutions to path planning problems where the
3:02:16
utility is some profit and due to flash loans you can functionally finance any
3:02:22
sequence of actions which is a path through the network that realizes a positive financial utility so what we're
3:02:29
seeing with a lot of this um you know hack not hacked defy multi mechanism
3:02:35
stuff is the discovery that our you know web of dfi Lego blocks aren't really
3:02:41
Lego blocks at all they're more like connects meaning they have kind of specific rules about what can connect to
3:02:47
what when and if you wire thing together wrong or you plug them together in certain ways you get unintended
3:02:52
consequences but a lot of the flash loans and a lot of this sort of what I'll call plaque path planning like
3:02:58
manipulation that goes on actually helps clean out the stuff that that's unsafe are unstable so sort of in a meta sense
3:03:05
these attacks are good for this ecology of interrelated games but from a
3:03:11
research standpoint we can take this from first principles and look at the way that composed games games with
3:03:17
shared states and multiple mechanisms actually result in these kinds of no
3:03:23
multi multi hoc multi mechanism you know sequences of actions that you could
3:03:29
batch up to get to get positive utilities and overtime what we're gonna hopefully see is that exploitive
3:03:36
sequences sort of disappear because things break or go down or get fixed and
3:03:42
that the remaining sort of path planning style solutions are actually productive
3:03:47
meaning they're they're positive some combinations of actions that make this
3:03:53
whole web of contracts into something more like a sense making engine and less like a sort of financial global utility
3:04:02
optimizer which is kind of the way that we have our markets described today as if there's one real global utility as we
3:04:10
get this sort of web of interacting things that all kind of have their own local information both at the individual
3:04:16
level and at this sort of subsystem level or sub game level you know we can hope or at least I hope that we're
3:04:23
seeing a movement towards this financial system more as a sense making system and less as a you know I hate to say it less
3:04:31
as an optimization algorithm in the absolute sense more as an optimization algorithm in the estimation sense which
3:04:36
is kind of bringing us back to sense making so that is the end of my talk I hope it was interesting thank you so
3:04:44
much second so I have a really interesting question yeah but you only
3:04:50
have one minute to answer it because the zum-zum meeting is actually automatically going to sign off in five
3:04:57
minutes want to tell people where they can find the videos and so forth the question is so because you're at the intersection
3:05:04
between academia and and really also the cutting edge implementation of funding curves and also a lot of other
3:05:09
primitives in this space where do you think token engineering is going to be in one year in five years and in 10
3:05:15
years from sort of an an epistemic Foundation perspective but also from an
3:05:20
impact perspective do you have yeah all right so one minute gotcha all right so I'll try to be as brief as possible so
3:05:27
one year all I really want in one year is a cohesive community with a set of
3:05:32
sufficiently shared values that we would what an external party would recognize it that like you know in from the inside
3:05:39
perspective we have enough alignment that we can function as a as
3:05:45
collaborators to contribute to furthering this and that externally people go oh yeah that those are the
3:05:50
people to talk to you maybe the way that in a very small sense we would think about an engineering society in five
3:05:57
years I would like it to be functionally like an engineering society having established some standards and norms
3:06:03
providing some you know whether it's conferences in the traditional sense or more events like this that are ongoing
3:06:09
learning so if you you would imagine going into that community to learn about the best practices so it's
3:06:15
simultaneously teaching and creating and applying standards and that that would serve as the backbone of this sort of
3:06:23
interoperable network because we have people who are in a way taking responsibility for the public good in
3:06:30
the context of infrastructure meaning not everyone should understand everything you should trust the social
3:06:36
institution responsible for upholding the safety of that infrastructure to continue to uphold the safety of that
3:06:43
infrastructure and then maybe after 10 years we might hope that that would be
3:06:48
recognized beyond the sort of immediate field so even at five years I'm talking
3:06:54
about largely that institutions servicing other members of the crypto
3:07:00
institution but that by 10 maybe it's recognized even beyond the borders of
3:07:05
its immediate sort of users again the way that an engineering society you
3:07:10
might say well like I appreciate the civil engineers even though all I do is
3:07:16
just drive on roads and never think about that cool thank you so much that was awesome so because we're gonna sign
3:07:22
off in two minutes I would like to spend it speakers for preparing these awesome
3:07:28
talks I know we've been quite corrective and kind of shaping engineering the event a little bit so it was a bit of
3:07:34
extra effort I think it paid out also thanks to the audience we had I think maximum 82 people after two hours there
3:07:42
was still 75 people on this call which is a very acceptable journey I think for a there's the evening token Bonnie curve
3:07:49
event also this was really an experiment in terms of in terms of event formats if
3:07:55
you have feedback on what worked well what didn't work well please do share it I think more it's you can if you can
3:08:00
share your email address I think yeah I would also like let me the the people
3:08:08
who'd old quarters I think it was quite a ride through topic of porn curse that we had known the last three hours and we
3:08:15
could meet your expectations and also deemed a mystify this design discipline
3:08:22
up before you but would also give you a good impression off of some real good use cases only way so thanks a lot to
3:08:29
all speakers for for your valuable insights but also particularly to the
3:08:35
audience for participating and finally yeah we have to bring more such invest
3:08:41
for you so if you want to learn more about our engineering broaden your network a bit we are looking for help
3:08:47
hands along the way so yeah thanks a lot my side



Ep 70 : Economics of Play to Earn Gaming Economy 
(source: https://youtu.be/wzzexO58xW8?si=8myJdZFs0qMmm04e)


Intro
0:00
[Music]
0:04
welcome to another episode at economics
0:06
design today we're going to talk about
0:08
something different instead of the usual
0:10
defy or usual layer 1 layer 2 blockchain
0:13
platforms we are going to focus on play
0:16
to earn games i want to start talking
0:18
about this because we have a big report
Core Premise
0:20
we shared and researched and published
0:22
on the primer of how to design the
0:24
economics of play to earn games or the
0:26
economics of blockchain games before we
0:28
get started what is this core premise
0:30
that we're talking about when we're
0:31
talking about blockchain games or just
0:32
games in general we're really talking
0:34
about a market a market is where people
0:36
come together to trade and transact they
0:39
could be building guilts they could be
0:40
doing they could be going on tournaments
0:42
they could be doing different different
0:46
battles
0:47
but these are all different types of
0:49
transactions between agents and every
0:51
time these transactions happen value is
0:53
being created so what we're talking
0:54
about here is as a game we're talking
0:57
about a market in a market value has
0:59
been created if value is not created in
1:01
the market people don't find value in
1:03
coming to your market people just leave
1:04
a market exists because it provides
1:07
value to the users who are transacting
1:09
on the market that being said why do we
1:11
need this paper why do we need this
1:12
research
1:13
because these markets are very very
1:15
complex it's a lot more complex than d5
1:18
which is already complex in play to earn
1:20
games on blockchain games or just games
1:22
in general you have so many different
1:24
kind of interactions transactions
1:26
activities that can be done to create
1:27
value for your users in the game your
1:30
gamers your your developers your
1:32
investors different kind of people in
1:34
your game so what we're looking at in
1:35
this paper is to understand is there is
1:37
there a model or a framework to start
1:40
designing the economics of the game
1:42
because in games there are two things
1:44
that's really really complicated the
1:46
first one is the aesthetics of the game
1:48
the game play how things are done how
1:49
things are designed how do you render
1:51
graphics in your computer the second
1:53
thing that's also very difficult to nail
1:55
down which is i guess it's a little bit
1:56
harder is the economics of these complex
1:59
games it's the economics of how these
2:01
different
2:02
assets or agents or transactions that is
2:05
flowing within your economy that's also
2:07
very complicated and i don't know how to
2:08
do the first one in game design as in
2:11
designing the aesthetics and rendering
2:12
of games but i do have some insights of
2:15
figuring out how the economics of these
2:17
games work so together with lemniscap
2:19
and four other researchers we have luka
2:21
dan denelli and john marco all of us
2:23
came together to create this paper which
2:24
is a primer for blockchain games and it
2:27
is very very interesting i want to share
2:29
that with you moving forward we can use
2:31
this as a framework
2:33
to start applying them to analyze the
2:35
various kind of games that's out there
2:36
the reason why i say the word framework
2:38
not model is that
2:40
there is no one model that fits all the
2:42
various games in the world a model is
2:44
something that's fixed a framework is uh
2:47
it's something that you can use as
2:48
reference to start building your game so
2:50
there is no one model that fits all
2:52
games unfortunately i really wish there
2:54
was but at least we have a framework and
2:56
i'm going to share this framework with
2:57
you we use this framework to analyze 12
2:59
different games
The Framework
3:01
from all the way from complex games very
3:03
different kind of complex games
3:05
different great game strategies and game
3:06
mechanisms we use this framework to
3:09
analyze them and understand how the
3:11
framework can be applied
3:13
and they come up with a summary that you
3:14
can use and the reason why we created
3:16
this is mainly in two folds the first
3:18
one is the primary primary reason is for
3:21
designers and developers as i mentioned
3:23
designing a game designing game
3:24
aesthetics game visuals rendering of
3:26
game very complicated very very
3:28
difficult people who can do that great
3:30
job now you have that you need to design
3:32
the gameplay the economics of the game
3:34
works is there too many too much coins
3:36
is there too little coins is there over
3:37
an inflation or hyper inflation in your
3:39
game that's very important because that
3:41
will help your game to be sustainable in
3:44
the long run this framework is to help
3:45
game designers game developers to design
3:48
the economics of the game the second
3:49
people that we we hope to target are
3:51
investors because blockchain games are
3:53
quite new and how do you want to analyze
3:55
and figure out the
3:58
the games
3:59
or how do you want to evaluate the games
4:01
are quite complicated and quite
4:02
difficult so hopefully this becomes a
4:04
primer and a basic framework for you to
4:06
start understanding and analyzing the
4:08
robustness of these games so let's get
4:10
started and dive deep into the various
4:12
topics the first section of the report
4:14
talks about the various personas so
4:15
again we talk about markets a market
4:17
where users come together trade and
4:20
transact
4:21
now
4:22
we can do that we can create markets we
4:23
can figure out a lot of things to trade
4:25
and transact because we can design them
4:27
on their own on on our we can design
Personas
4:30
them as developed but who are these
4:31
people coming to trade and we've
4:32
identified five key personas of people
4:35
who come into trade players
4:37
builders developers investors as well as
4:40
collectors nft collectors so these are
4:42
the five core personas that we see in p2
4:45
p2e games or blockchain games this
4:47
framework can also be used for
4:48
non-blockchain games and you potentially
4:51
do not have your nft collectors but or
4:53
maybe your investors will be a very
4:55
different kind of investor
4:56
but understanding the personas that you
4:58
have in the game will be very important
5:00
because everything else we do after
5:02
these other these other components of
5:04
the framework will be applied to these
5:06
personas so section one or segment one
5:08
of the report talks about the various
5:10
personas and diving deep into who the
5:12
personas are and what they do but just
5:14
in general the developers the players
5:17
the builders
5:18
and the investors as well as collectors
Framework
5:20
then we start moving into the framework
5:22
do you remember the framework that we've
5:23
always used market design mechanism
5:26
design and token design market design is
5:28
designing the parameters of the game
5:30
so agents economic agents or or user
5:34
personas are one of them then we also
5:36
want to understand what are the other
5:37
components that are the parameters of
5:39
the game the second one is mechanism
5:40
design these are the rules the rules in
5:43
the game that you embed these are
5:44
economic policies economic rules these
5:47
are rules in the game and lastly we have
5:48
token design token design more
5:50
specifically the monetary policy of the
5:52
game of course we can expand further
5:55
into looking at nfts as tokens but in
5:58
general the idea is monetary policy so
Market Design
6:00
let's take a little dive into each of
6:02
these and what do they mean when we talk
6:04
about market design we're looking at
6:06
three things ugc use user generated
6:10
content we look at nft and in-game
6:12
usability as well as the value creation
6:15
value sinks and value distribution again
6:17
remember market design is the various
6:19
parameters that we have in the game so
6:20
we talk about ugc ugc is user-generated
6:23
content
6:24
some games allow users to generate their
6:26
content some games allow some certain
6:29
type of users to generate content and
6:31
some games do not allow
6:34
generation of content at all so for
6:36
example take a look at sandbox sandbox
6:38
is a game it's kind of like the crypto
6:40
version of minecraft
6:42
and users can generate their own content
6:44
build their own infrastructure and be
6:46
their own bridges build their own
6:47
skyscrapers
6:48
to play in the game some games like star
6:50
atlas they do have a level of user
6:53
generated content instead of the user as
6:55
the as in the players generating content
6:57
it is the developers themselves
6:59
generating content as time goes by and
7:01
some games just do not have user
7:03
generated content at all there is no
7:05
right or wrong just understanding having
7:07
awareness of these various components of
7:10
the things that can be customized cannot
7:12
be customized is going to be important
7:14
in the game the second thing we talk
7:16
about in market design is nfts and
7:19
in-game usability nfts is quite a big
7:22
component of this entire play to earn
7:24
game the nft can be in terms of vanity
7:27
items like skins or the nft could be
7:30
something that generates a form of
7:32
income or some some form of asset in
7:35
your system so it could be land it could
7:37
be spaceship it could be a robot suit it
7:40
could be a gun it could be a racing
7:43
track whereas the vanity item is more of
7:45
the skins so like
7:46
the design of
7:48
how you
7:50
design your your robot costumes
7:52
in your game or how you design your
7:55
battleship in your game so nft depending
Value Creation
7:58
on the nft and how it is being used they
8:00
help to define the parameters of your of
8:03
your market design of your market and
8:05
lastly its value creation value sync and
8:07
value distribution remember the first
8:09
thing i talk about here as in why we
8:11
need a market is that a market creates
8:13
value value is being generated that's
8:15
why a market exists what happens when
8:17
you generate value the important thing
8:18
is that it needs to be distributed it
8:20
needs to be turned into real value and
8:21
then it needs to be distributed to
8:23
everyone in the game and then it needs
8:24
to be sync as well because you have
8:26
value creation and then you need some
8:28
ways to reduce and sync the value
8:30
otherwise you have this thing called
8:32
hyperinflation just like how in the
8:34
economy you have busted booms up and
8:36
down
8:37
bear and and blue and bear and good and
8:40
bad
8:41
you also have similar kind of
8:43
infrastructure within your economy you
8:45
can't keep going up up up all the way
8:47
that's probably a ponzi scam
8:49
you have different variations in your
8:52
game because the market changes all the
8:54
time and you need to be able to
8:55
anticipate that market change so
8:57
understanding what causes value creation
9:00
values things how do you distribute
9:02
value that's going to be very important
9:04
and when we talk about
9:05
inflation for example it's not just
9:07
currency inflation but also asset
9:09
inflation so these are some components
9:11
to think about when you're designing the
9:13
parameters of your market the second
9:14
thing
9:15
is mechanism design the main things that
9:17
we're talking about will be governance
9:19
revenue model business model and network
9:22
effects when it comes to governance you
9:23
know governance is still a very very
9:25
broad topic and it's how you govern this
9:27
entire system initially right now i see
9:30
that a lot of games their long-term goal
9:31
is to decentralize right now they're
9:33
still centralizing it which is
9:34
completely normal and completely fine
9:36
you need a level of centralization to
9:38
bootstrap and kick-start your entire
9:40
economy then you can start to slowly
9:42
decentralize that's completely normal we
Revenue Models
9:44
talk about revenue models there are four
9:46
kind of revenue models we're looking at
9:47
direct revenue model rental employee or
9:50
scholarship as well as asset so direct
9:52
revenue is you know getting money
9:54
directly rental is renting your asset
9:56
out scholarship is giving us
9:59
giving scholarships or hiring someone to
10:01
use your asset to work and then asset is
10:04
just the asset it generates revenue on
10:06
its own so for example you have an nft
10:09
that's a land and people get to
10:11
use people pay you to use the land to
10:15
make battles or fight or mine something
10:17
then you get to earn tokens from there
10:19
that's asset revenue so depending on the
10:21
different kind of revenue models you
10:23
have different ways of structuring your
10:25
mechanism
10:26
or the economic policies in your game
10:28
that being said the other side of
Business Models
10:30
revenue model is your business model in
10:32
business model we have two ends and then
10:35
everything in between so one end is free
10:37
to play and one end is pay to play there
10:41
is no right or wrong it's just a
10:43
different type of a different
10:46
as a scalar of what kind of games there
10:48
are so free to play is that anyone can
10:50
come in to play the game pay to play is
10:53
that you have to to pay to
10:55
to participate in the game
10:57
so and then you have everything in
10:58
between depending on your business model
11:00
you have very different kind of
11:01
considerations for assets asset
11:04
inflation currency inflation and the
11:06
types of assets that you're giving out
11:08
for free the other kind of
11:10
business model the other kind of
11:11
mechanisms or or just models in your
11:14
system is paid to win
11:16
that's a different kind of system as
11:18
well where users can pay to win in your
11:20
system or in your in your game again
11:23
these are different kind of
11:24
considerations because depending on how
11:27
long you want your game to last you know
11:29
is it is there fairness in the game is
11:31
there are you rewarding or incentivizing
11:34
certain kind of activities and actions
11:36
whereas someone is someone is being the
11:38
trade-off of this entire of this entire
11:40
activity or this entire transaction now
Network Effects
11:43
these are things to consider when you're
11:45
choosing these models there is no right
11:47
or wrong it really really depends on the
11:50
models you're building and one other
11:51
thing i want to highlight in mechanism
11:53
design is network effects so network
11:55
effects is not something that is is
11:57
fixed more importantly network effects
11:59
goes to a segment one in in terms of
12:02
user persona so understanding what
12:04
personas they are how do they interact
12:06
with each other and what are some
12:07
considerations that we need to think
12:09
about so for example
12:10
the first user we had we talked about as
12:13
players you want to understand what kind
12:14
of interaction a relationship players
12:17
have between each other players have
12:19
with builders players have collectors
12:21
players have with developers players
12:22
have investors what kind of
12:25
economic activity do they do they
12:27
interact or do they engage in what kind
12:29
of transactions do they engage in when
12:31
players interact with players when
12:33
players interact with investors these
12:34
are all the various permutations of
12:36
economic activities and transactions
12:39
that should be built into your model
12:40
that should be built into your your
12:42
rules of your economy of your universe
12:45
hence this is mechanism design because
12:47
this is rules of the game depending on
12:48
what kind of economic activities they
12:50
are you have different kind of rules for
Monetary Policy
12:52
different kind of agents and lastly it's
12:54
monetary policy so with monetary policy
12:56
what we want to do ideally is to balance
12:58
between inflationary and deflationary
13:00
pressures that's literally what the fed
13:02
does the federal reserve of central
13:04
banks they are helping to manage
13:06
inflationary and deflationary pressures
13:08
and what what is the whole point of that
13:10
ultimately what it wants to do is that
13:13
you can translate the value created you
13:16
know you as a user as a person going to
13:19
tournaments using my robot or using my
13:21
spaceship there is value being created
13:24
and i want to turn this into real value
13:26
in the system or real value in my in my
13:28
bank account and so this is where
13:30
monetary policy comes in so to put it
13:31
more concretely let's take a look at an
13:34
example that luca has created and you
13:36
can you can read more about it in the
13:39
report that that we have and i'll link
13:41
it above
13:43
so what we see over here is an
13:44
expansionary cycle of xc infinity or
13:47
just any any game in general and in a
13:51
game usually we have we have the
13:54
gamers and players builders these are
13:56
the various economic
13:57
economic users or economic agents and
14:01
then we also have the nfts which are the
14:03
goods being produced in the system so
14:05
you take xc to breed axes and then
14:08
that's there's an nft and these are
14:10
goods that's created in this exec xc
14:13
infinity economy so let's take a look at
14:15
an
14:15
an expansionary case study so we have
14:18
the demand of of nfts the demand of x's
14:20
these are local demand goods from your
14:23
economy because of expansionary the
14:25
demand pressure goes up more people want
14:27
to buy this more people want to buy
14:29
xc more people want to buy nfts because
14:32
you want to collect them or you want to
14:33
play them because you buy xe with your
14:35
native currency then the demand for your
14:37
native currency increases so when the
14:40
demand of nft native currency increases
14:42
it attracts more people to come into the
14:44
game so you have this as population
14:45
growth and
14:47
as more people come into the game
14:48
because of how xa infinity works you
14:51
also have new currency being minted new
14:54
new native currency being entered into
14:55
the system so it helps to reduce the
14:58
pressure
14:59
of the domestic currency inflationary
15:02
basically more people want to buy x
15:03
infinity more people demand the local
15:05
currency to buy xa infinity the local
15:08
currency increases in value it attracts
15:11
more people to come into the game to
15:13
play
15:14
and because more people come into the
15:15
game to play it increases it creates new
15:18
native currency as well and it helps to
15:20
reduce this pressure at the same time as
15:22
more people come into play the secondary
15:24
effect is also that they will start
15:26
creating new nfts breeding new xc
15:28
increasing the breeding rate and all the
15:31
other aspects of increasing nfts so this
15:34
increases the supply which helps to
15:36
dampen the demand and then
15:38
the supply demand now will be meshed it
15:41
will be equilibrium and the demand here
15:43
wouldn't be overheated
15:45
and so this becomes
15:47
becomes smoother and softer
15:50
so this is the general idea of the
15:52
expansionary aspects so what can we do
15:54
with this so what if we can figure out
15:56
the entire life cycle of this economy
15:59
well the important thing is to
16:01
understand what are some parameters that
16:03
we can tweak so that we can allow this
16:05
economy and this system to be stable to
16:07
be to be sustainable
16:10
you see two impacts here the first one
16:12
is the strength of the local currency
16:14
and the supply of the nft so this is
16:17
your nft farming and this is your your
16:20
new new tokens being minted in the
16:22
native token sets so what we look at
16:24
over here are figuring out what are the
16:26
various parameters that you can create
16:28
within your system to make it easier to
16:31
farm or harder to farm so let's say
16:34
there's a huge demand of nfts and you're
16:37
afraid of everything going overheating
16:39
you're afraid of crazy inflation in your
16:41
system and we need to increase the
16:43
supply of nfts
16:45
we need to increase the supply of nfts
16:46
so that the demand of nft is equalized
16:49
so what can you do so you can you can
16:51
make these
16:52
the supply of nft you can make it easier
16:54
to increase the supply of nft so think
16:56
of it as you know
16:58
to create a supply of nft you need to do
17:00
an exam the easier the exam is the more
17:02
people pass the more people pass the
17:04
more nft is created the more difficult
17:06
the exam is the less people pass less
17:08
less nft is being minted so in the same
17:11
way if let's say right now you need a
17:12
lot of nfts to balance out the demand
17:15
you make your exam easy anyone who goes
17:16
through this stage
17:18
will will pass the exam and then more
17:20
nft is created let's say it's
17:22
contractionary you want to have you want
17:24
to have less supply of nfts you make the
17:26
exam harder less people able to pass the
17:29
exam less nft minted and it helps to
17:32
stabilize your economy so this is what i
Mechanism Design
17:35
meant by oh this is what in general we
17:37
found out in the research that monetary
17:39
policy is about balancing the supply and
17:42
the inflationary and deflationary
17:43
pressure and to get to this point of
17:45
inflationary and deflationary pressure
17:47
we need to go to mechanism design which
17:48
are rules of the game what's the revenue
17:50
model what is the business model what
17:51
are what's the governance like what is
17:53
the network effects how do users
17:55
interact with each other and before we
17:56
go there we need to figure out what are
17:58
the parameters of the market who are in
18:01
the game
18:02
who what kind of ugc is there what kind
18:05
of nfts are there how is the nft being
18:07
used in the system what is how is
18:10
network being distributed and created
18:12
and shared and destroyed in your economy
18:14
and once you have all these together
18:16
then you can start thinking about
18:18
building
18:19
a very robust economy get start thinking
18:21
about mixing
18:23
these various components together to
18:25
start designing your economy and then we
18:27
move on to section three in section
18:28
three we talk about we talk exactly
18:30
about that how does value creation and
18:32
value things will be linked to
18:35
revenue creation that will be linked to
18:36
monetary policy so it basically just
18:39
tries to tie everything together more in
18:41
smaller chunks so that you don't get
18:44
over over inflated in ideas in your head
18:47
to make sense of what the entire report
18:49
is doing in the next section we're going
18:50
to talk about recommendations that kifa
18:52
will be bringing you through in the
18:54
recommendations section of the report we
18:56
outline a decision-making process that
18:58
can help pwe game designers plan or
19:01
investors to evaluate an economy
19:04
we display this process through these
19:05
two flowcharts
19:07
the first question that we examine is is
19:10
it important the nft be actively used
19:12
within that game
19:13
if not you're free to distribute the
19:15
income directly and passively and this
19:17
can increase the value of the nft as
19:19
more users are willing to purchase an
19:21
asset that they don't have to actively
19:23
manage
19:24
but if it is important that that nft be
19:26
actively used then you should create the
19:28
incentive
19:29
by distributing the income based on that
19:31
usage
19:33
next examine if there is a measure of
19:35
player skill or strategy available if so
19:38
it's preferable to distribute the income
19:40
based on that measure
19:43
as it better rewards the real players
19:45
who make up the core of the economy
19:47
rather than those who are using bots or
19:49
multiple accounts who are just trying to
19:51
extract value from that economy
19:53
if not you can distribute based on
19:54
participation but make sure to create
19:58
some technical limitations to prevent
20:00
those bots and other exploitative users
20:04
going into the second chart i want to
20:05
look at if the goal is to have the game
20:09
be accessible to a wide player base
20:11
if yes i'd recommend leaning in the
20:13
free-to-play direction as even if you
20:16
have a pay-to-play game with a scholar
20:18
program that's still more friction than
20:20
a free-to-play game for onboarding new
20:22
users with low bank rolls
20:25
if that's not as important next want to
20:27
look at is the game a player versus
20:29
player or a player versus environment
20:32
scenario
20:34
if it's a player versus environment and
20:36
there's not as much
20:38
conflict directly between players
20:41
then you want to look at if the there is
20:43
a reward loop within the game that is
20:45
reliant on having drops of items with
20:47
utility
20:49
if so
20:51
it means that there's an important
20:52
component of the game
20:53
revolving around ordering items to
20:55
progress
20:56
and if players can just buy the best
20:58
items they may soon realize that they
21:00
just took a lot of fun out of the game
21:02
and that can really undermine the whole
21:04
process
21:05
and so it can be preferable in that case
21:08
to make assets with utility non-tradable
21:10
and focus the in-game economy or the
21:12
real value economy
21:14
around more cosmetic assets
21:17
but if this isn't a really important
21:20
component of the game and it won't
21:22
undermine any of the fun
21:25
then you're free to make the assets with
21:26
utility tradable
21:29
uh if you're going more in the pvp
21:31
direction you want to look at how
21:33
acceptable is it for the game to be
21:34
perceived as pay to win
21:37
this can be a problem in a lot of games
21:39
with some users objecting to this and so
21:41
if that's something that should be
21:43
avoided look more in the free-to-play
21:45
direction and having assets with utility
21:48
be non-tradable
21:50
though if pay to win is acceptable
21:53
then
21:54
you can make assets with utility
21:55
tradeable and lean more in the
21:56
pay-to-play direction
21:58
and this is going to be
22:00
a little bit more of a realistic economy
22:03
although there is some kind of middle
22:05
ground as well
22:06
if you have separate uh
22:09
areas within the game where
22:11
in one area it's equalized and so
22:14
no one has
22:15
an advantage for paying more and then on
22:17
the other side the you can still create
22:20
an incentive for whales to purchase
22:21
assets by having a separate area where
22:23
they can gain the full advantage and
Conclusion
22:25
lastly the whole point of this is that
22:27
gamify is very complicated
22:30
it is not an easy topic and that's why
22:32
we chose we took a very long time to
22:34
start writing this very complex paper
22:36
this is not something that's just
22:38
relevant to the on-chain world but it's
22:40
also relevant to the off-chain
22:41
traditional game world and this is
22:43
really really exciting and very
22:45
interesting because
22:46
right now we are and in this we are able
22:49
to embrace technology to start building
22:52
very new and very interesting kind of
22:54
universes mechanisms markets or
22:57
economies and this is very exciting
22:59
because maybe there are new ways that we
23:01
can start looking at at markets there
23:03
are new ways in which we can start
23:05
creating new interactions on new
23:06
economic activities in a market and we
23:09
can do that with games so i know there
23:12
are some people talking about how you
23:13
know game is a scam and ft is a scam
23:15
everything's a scam the only thing
23:17
that's real is go bars
23:19
and i get that you know you have
23:20
different kind of opinions different
23:21
ideas i think the thing that i want to
23:23
embrace over here is that we're we have
23:26
the power we have the tool today with
23:27
the technology and tool today to start
23:30
building and crafting the economic
23:32
models that we would like to explore we
23:35
can start defining the economic policies
23:37
in which we
23:39
we incentivize economic agents to come
23:41
together to work and transact and we can
23:43
do this in a very fun way through games
23:46
and ultimately it'd be really fun to
23:48
start taking empirical data and study
23:50
them to understand how these different
23:52
economic
23:53
economic activities or economic markets
23:55
work
23:56
because
23:58
these are all very interesting systems
24:00
so i just want to share that this is a
24:02
very interesting crossroad where we have
24:04
the right tools and technology to start
24:06
building new ways of value creation and
24:08
value distribution this is just the
24:10
beginning and i hope you download the
24:11
paper to read it join us on our twitter
24:13
spaces join us on our discord happy to
24:16
chat anytime and hopefully you find that
24:19
it has a lot of value just as i think it
24:21
has added a lot of value to me as i did
24:23
this research together with the entire
24:25
team
24:26
so thank you very much and i'll speak to
24:28
you the next time bye
24:32
thank you so much for staying throughout
24:33

24:41
these videos for free as well without
24:43
any ads and also grab the book that i've
24:46
talked about earlier on the book
24:48
summarizes a lot of what we're trying to
24:49
build what we're trying to design and
24:51
the different aspects that can be
24:52
changed during the entire design process
24:55
we also just launched econtaric econ
24:57
turret is really economics plus esoteric
25:00
because this space is so complicated and
25:02
so difficult what we want to do is to
25:04
make it easier for anyone to come and
25:06
learn and be part of this system
25:09
so in econ tariq we are breaking down
25:10
the different analytics and different
25:12
data to give you more insights to
25:14
understand the robustness from a very
25:16
fundamental level of the health of this
25:18
ecosystem so check out ikontarik.com and
25:21
i'll see you there
25:23
bye

0:49
it's to onboard the next million enthusiastic users to the factory evolution
0:55
and that is why we bring to you this one of a kind master class transitioning into f3
1:02
you know the world is heading towards a very closed ecosystem let it be in any industry all industries
1:09
are coming together some all other place to build communities and who is at their forefront
1:16
it's web 3 web 3 is all about building communities
1:22
through the power of decentralization blockchain and the best part you
1:28
with this i bring to you today's event transitioning powered by rekurum
1:33
transitioning into f3 but before we enter into what is the event about and who is joining us for
1:40
our master class let me tell you something about what requirement does
1:46
web3 is a new internet and it's for anyone and everyone who wants to be a part of an ecosystem which is efficient
1:54
which is transparent autonomous and for you
1:59
this is where recruitment steps in and we help even attendees disc discover web 3 jobs at professional events like
2:07
their conferences webinars master classes like these and even offline meetups
2:13
from various industries in simple recruitment connects web three
2:18
professionals we have three companies with web3 professionals advertise
2:24
today we have 75 plus companies offering a plethora of jobs to all of
2:30
you we are also providing nft minted certificates for whosoever is attending
2:37
this event from the start till the end so for uh for having a unique memory for
2:43
today log on to the recurring website join the event log on to the discussion room and put
2:51
your wallet addresses in the chat box
2:56
this is how you don't be able to get your nft into certificates not only that
3:01
i'd like to thank our sponsors also for today which is uniform and our partners
3:06
machinations with that let me introduce you the speaker for today the speaker for today
3:13
is alexander and he's a person who is very enthusiastic and has always been
3:18
into understanding games computers and how the whole
3:23
development works and that is where his experience in these fields has made
3:30
him work for a company in game development and he works as a
3:36
game consultant over there so let's welcome alexander coles from machinations
3:42
alexander yeah hello everyone uh so as well
3:48
hi hi yeah uh so i work as a design consultant with machinations uh previously
3:55
i was working as a blockchain consultant uh raising money for blockchain projects
4:01
writing their white papers and advising on the tokenomics strategy so currently
4:07
i'm working with machinations which is a sas company so we provide
4:12
software as a service solutions to traditional gaming studios from triple a standard to
4:19
indie studios and we also offer our services to web3 awesome awesome
4:25
so this sounds really great you know like i sometimes feel when we started off gaming like you know when gaming
4:31
started we played road rash we played super mario contra even gta right and
4:36
now even we can play things in the meta words right correct so somewhere i learned that everything involves
4:42
mathematics uh physics like if if object is flying from this position to this position there is a certain time
4:48
fraction over there that has to be maintained and all of this was actually done using
4:54
major large excel sheets right and lots of standard old school traditions right
4:59
so would you like to tell me how mach nations actually understood this problem how they came up with the solution
5:05
and how this actually came into play would you like to you know uh shed some light over there
5:11
yeah absolutely uh so machinations was founded by a man called uh doris dormance he was he's an author in a game
5:19
design he's quite famous in game design actually he was did a phd
5:24
uh at the university of amsterdam and then using his phd which was written more just over 10 years ago
5:32
there were the founders of our company mihai and a few other people that came together and essentially they took what
5:38
was published as the phd and they put it as a piece of software as an interactive
5:44
piece of software um and you asked me a question of what is the value uh
5:50
using this exactly so see we actually know that we love playing games right but what goes behind it is actually very
5:57
complex so how has mac nations made it very simple for game designers
6:03
okay sure sure i understand uh so that's essentially when it comes to testing the systems of a game and running the
6:11
simulations the traditional uh methods of testing games has been using excel
6:16
spreadsheets and python coding uh so just imagine that if you are making a
6:22
game and you want to know what is going to happen in 200 days 500 days
6:27
what's going to happen to the balance of your economy and those other systems that go on say
6:33
for example if there is a boss fight or a leveling system uh all these things are very complex and
6:40
ideally what you want is a balanced game a game that keeps the player engaged is interactive
6:48
and also the game that the economy isn't just going to blow up because obviously we saw what happened with infinity so a
6:55
situation like with axi infinity where the whole economy crashed
7:00
yes their economy is linked to crypto because it's a crypto game however they could have prevented a lot of the
7:06
problems that they did have if in the construction of that economic system they had more uh drains
7:14
yeah so actually this is why machinations is a good tool to use because you can
7:21
simulate and predict what is going to happen more efficiently than using spreadsheets
7:26
and python they so uh as much as i understand it's
7:31
basically solving problem for various companies it's not only about game design it's about uh how a company can
7:39
know when you know um they want to invest again like you know the vesting
7:44
period should start again in the economy uh in their own economy or it should you know continue as it goes so to stop the
7:50
burst or the move of their particular economy am i correct yeah yeah exactly you can actually
7:56
prevent the bust of the economy you can see what's going to happen to the token in the future
8:04
right so um why don't you tell us like how simplified it is like would you like
8:09
to share skin and tell us that how are normal gamer like let's say a beginner like me okay if i would want to log on
8:16
to machinations and see how simply can i make a simple design like if someone can
8:21
you know earn tokens and sell it normally and then you know continue the whole cycle would you like
8:27
to you know go ahead with that okay sure i'll share my screen
8:41
okay so uh this is the machinations diagram our machinations is a object-based
8:48
language which means we're using these different objects so we've actually got 11 objects
8:56
and then we've got these other connecting points so the first object is a source you can think of a source as
9:02
your starting point so in this instance this is a simple model of a web 3 economy so i'll just go through this
9:09
diagram first so the player opens their computer phone starts to
9:15
play the game and then they are earning tokens these tokens go into a pool the pool could be
9:21
like your bag or wherever the tokens accumulate it's a storage area
9:27
and now why the web 3 economies are more complex is because we have a marketplace in
9:34
traditional gaming we don't have a marketplace where players can sell their in-game items
9:40
but in web 3 we have that which is another layer of complexity so the
9:45
player has a choice they can for example reinvest the tokens and buy
9:50
nfts and then they've got more nfts and by having more nfts maybe they can
9:57
earn more tokens yeah so this this is a feedback loop right here or the player has the option they can
10:04
take the tokens out from the game they can sell it on the marketplace such as openc
10:10
and then these uh tokens that that's going to have a price yeah
10:16
the price in crypto because they're selling their token which might be written on uh the solana
10:23
blockchain so then they then receive solana there's also something called player
10:28
choice so in this whole cycle here what we what we're trying to simulate and understand
10:35
is what is the chance of a player making a certain decision and when they make that decision what is the influence of
10:42
their decisions over a period of time on the economy of
10:47
a gay so we've got the source which is a starting point as i said a drain
10:54
a pool and this one here this is a gate and why machinations is special is because if
11:02
you want to test true randomness which is called monte carlo simulation
11:07
monte carlo simulation of course comes from monte carlo where all the casinos
11:13
are uh because when you roll a dice that when you roll a dice that's true
11:18
randomness but to try to simulate true randomness in excel is incredibly
11:24
difficult most most people don't do it uh but with machinations you can
11:29
simulate monte carlo just with a drag and drop it's a quite easy so for example i can label things
11:37
here and i can select the the distribution so for this object right
11:42
here i can do monte carlo true random or i can do deterministic so deterministic
11:48
means for example if you've got 10 10 tokens coming in i can say that uh
11:55
four are gonna go this way and six are gonna go this way and then it will always do the same
12:00
thing and monte carlo would be just randomized
12:05
and the last thing that's quite important to know just for teaching you the basics here is the converter
12:11
so of course if you're taking tokens and then you're converting them into solana
12:16
then you would be using a converter right here uh and just to finish off with this
12:23
so why machinations is special is because what we can do is we can simulate what's
12:28
going to happen in many days ahead in the future in a short space of time
12:33
so what i'm going to do now is uh each of these steps is a player
12:38
day so one step is one player day and if i select 100 this is 100 player
12:44
days i can click here which is called batch plays and what this is going to do
12:50
is it's going to simulate what's going to happen in 100 days
12:56
and i can see that the earnings for the ethereum it's going up quite a
13:03
bit yeah and that so is the total nfts this is obviously a very simple diagram
13:09
um of a web 3 economy but the whole point is if you want to test different
13:14
variables and perimeters for balancing the game you can just change certain values so
13:21
like for example i can click here this is a formula of d3 so i can say there's going to be 2 and
13:27
not 3 or there can be a 10. and then i can run another simulation and i can see
13:33
how that performs so that's the whole idea uh does that make sense
13:41
okay so uh thank you so much alexander like this seems very intriguing i guess because see
13:47
we definitely know how to play games but what goes behind it is you know a very complex structure right which many game
13:54
designers actually feel very overwhelmed while using more traditional products and somewhere i feel you know um
14:00
while we use machinations it gives a very interactive feeling you know it has structures over there small
14:06
uh cubes and triangles which people can you know relate to rather than relating to code okay and numbers of excel sheets
14:14
right so that is how i guess it definitely helps out uh in creating the whole system very interactive
14:20
and human-centric okay so my next question actually involves around how you actually came into game
14:26
design because some as much as i know you did your you know like you have a background in uh investment and business
14:34
and you know psychology and social studies but then how did you jump and you know come from
14:39
that zone of business to directly to you know um becoming a game design consultant how does that procedure go
14:46
like how did it happen did it happen okay yeah so that's a good question so yeah just to summarize so a
14:53
number of years ago uh my my main background was in investing
14:58
uh actually i started in crypto in 2017. i was just a investor at that time i
15:03
also had a mining rig as well so i shared the mining oh yeah and uh we were mining ethereum and
15:11
bitcoin i i remember the price around that time sorry actually i we started 2015 for the
15:18
mining but then for the investing out of 2017. and at that time i think the price was around like 500 for a bitcoin or
15:25
something uh anyway if i try to make a long story uh short
15:30
how i came into is it was a process so from mining to investing and obviously
15:35
with an investing mindset you are analyzing and you're trying to choose the best investment right
15:42
so i think that process uh because obviously i experienced the bear market from 2017 to 2020
15:51
you know so i went through that process so like with now how the market is you
15:56
know i can understand it i'm not panicking or anything but anyway the point is to go from there in business
16:03
and investment side to to the design side well during my childhood i was a as a gamer i played a lot a lot a lot of
16:09
games you know fps mm mmorpg uh rpg games uh you name it like
16:17
i played i played mostly so the thing is if you are like a bit of a nerd like me and you
16:23
played a lot of games then you will understand the gaming systems exactly
16:30
yeah people are going yeah yeah so so i think that's like how i came into it and then recently with
16:36
machinations i got the job here because my previous job i actually had my own
16:42
startup which didn't work out long story made short other people in the company got offered
16:49
jobs for quite a high salary elsewhere and they decided that they didn't want to take the risk of continuing a startup
16:55
they would rather have a salary so they left i wasn't going to do things on my own
17:00
and then i got off of the job with machinations because i was head hunted
17:05
oh that's that's really awesome let's see uh uh let's go step by step here so
17:11
uh my first question actually comes around like see definitely you have that investing and business background right
17:17
and then you already had that mindset of a gamer so you knew how uh things
17:22
actually work economies can actually work so here somewhere i feel you know that's a very value-added point where
17:30
having a proper background in understanding how investment works and how economies can run can you know help
17:35
you become a game design consultant that's very definite like i certainly feel that you actually chose the best
17:41
course for yourself while coming you know building your career right and
17:46
whoever's listening to this you know they should also understand that they should know what skills they have what they can do what they have done
17:52
throughout their career even when they were kids even when you are playing games your you know brain is running like 24 times for various things
18:00
correct so i supposedly you know see a very good you know uh structure of how you have built yourself from starting as
18:08
you know a game lover who you know plays a lot of games in the k as a kid then you know doing their career in business
18:14
and then landing in game design right um so first question like what kind of games did you play like anything which
18:20
you would you know want to say which actually you know like uh blew you off your mind like something
18:25
which was very intriguing very amazing for you yeah yeah yeah
18:31
so uh one of my favorite games i used to play when i was a kid was uh warcraft
18:38
yeah warcraft reign of chaos warcraft uh the frozen throne and i love that game it
18:45
was so so cool uh and then finally they released world
18:50
of warcraft so it was taking the game that i already understood from looking from above as an rpg exactly
18:57
uh with with the strategy uh elements and the online playing and then to world
19:02
of warcraft where it's like okay i i can be one of those characters
19:08
and then i see it from a whole different perspective and obviously world of warcraft was one of the biggest and most
19:13
successful uh mmorpgs out there and i loved it i was i
19:18
was so like engaged in the game um yeah i know it was obviously a great
19:24
company as well uh because it was owned by blizzard which is now uh activision is it right
19:30
right right so see uh tell me this lately uh let's see there are usual
19:35
games out there like you know like gta is there or super mario or even you know uh fps
19:41
games or tps games as well so um like regular games that are out there currently
19:47
are they you know like easily compatible with machination software or you know how
19:53
these companies you know can use machinations as a product okay to
19:58
enhance what they're already doing okay for their customers for their users how can that how can
20:04
mach nations actually add value to these old companies as well is there a possibility or like uh how does it work
20:11
yeah yeah yeah yeah 100 so as i was saying we work from triple a
20:18
okay to like your very small projects so for these traditional games that are out
20:23
there that that are not on the blockchain we we do work with them and the value that they see is because if
20:29
you are a team of people and you're creating a game the thing is not all
20:35
game designers and creators are mathematical for a lot of them they don't like working with spreadsheets so
20:42
to use machinations which is an object-based language which is interactive it's it's it's a picture a
20:48
picture says a thousand words uh right so it's very easy to communicate across
20:53
what you're working on the vision uh and then talk with your team about
20:59
any like issues you have so for these traditional uh gaming studios
21:04
with the games that you talked about like super mario kart etc uh yeah they they they do find it useful
21:11
because it reduces the production time because time is money and if you can
21:17
create the game quicker uh actually we found from a survey of over 200 uh current customers
21:24
that there was an average saving of 20 percent
21:32
okay okay that's super you know like that's super useful for anyone who's trying to even develop tokenomics for
21:39
their current companies right because every company who's currently running into webster should have a very strong
21:45
token of x right and uh if they don't have a proper tokenomics how will they you know run their liquidity pool
21:51
and how will the whole um you know burning period or you know the value of the
21:57
token how it matters can be actually analyzed through machination so i you know and totally on the same page where
22:03
you know i believe vaccinations can be really helpful for even not only game designers but startup companies also
22:09
inductee who are trying to build their economics correct so here i have a question on tokenomics actually let's
22:16
take uh uh there's a normal random company who's wanting to build economics right so
22:21
uh first question what platform okay should they choose
22:27
to build it to economics like it should it should be on the social network ethereum network or you know finance
22:33
network okay so how to choose a network for their own token somewhere i feel it depends upon the
22:39
industry they're working in right like for maybe fashion related nfts it is a different project okay for game
22:45
designing it's a different project right so how uh a person who is wanting to build a tokenomics should first choose a
22:52
you know basically network on which they need to build the first layer network so would you like to tell
22:57
something about that yeah yeah sure sure so um a previous project i was working on it's a project called division six
23:04
which is the fastest growing esports academy in the uk uh and for what their project
23:10
they were going to have a process of micro transactions so if you are having a lot of micro transactions in the game
23:17
then you need to consider are you going to keep it on chain or off chain because if you want to keep everything on chain
23:25
then to keep the fees low you need to consider doing perhaps uh salana i
23:32
yeah okay however if you're going to keep things off chain then
23:38
there are uh other other codes out there that that you can use because i know elluvium in
23:44
my opinion i think as a case study if you're going to be doing lots of micro transactions in a
23:51
mmorpg kind of game which is what eluvian is
23:56
i would be looking at them as a case study and i would be following what they're doing and that's the easiest thing to do right
24:02
is just to look at the projects out there that are successful and comparing what you're working as a project to them
24:08
and seeing what they're doing which is working and what they're doing which isn't working and then taking a lesson from them because sometimes people do
24:16
things out of tradition and because they don't know rather than actually choosing the best
24:22
thing because that that was the most difficult thing with the project i was working with before they were like oh yeah we're going to do ethereum and then
24:28
i was asking what they're doing as a project and i was like well it doesn't make any sense because if you're using
24:34
ethereum you're doing micro transactions you're going to be paying so many fees at least
24:39
you you should choose a polygon it's polygon right
24:44
exactly so uh i can like would you like to give a little more uh effort on making people
24:50
understand what is a micro transaction like is it basically a change of token
24:56
or currency or is it a change of data or running from one point to another point because if that people understand better
25:03
what is a micro transaction right then uh it's better for them to understand is
25:08
it uh like their project is good for proof of stake or proof of work uh how does it work like you know if we
25:14
can you know explain even micro transactions in a little more detail yeah sure sure so
25:20
i would define a micro transaction as any kind of transaction which is like
25:26
under 50 yeah because if you look at the price of uh
25:32
sending ethereum or or buying like a certain nft that is using ethereum the cost is
25:39
normally like a 20 to fifty dollars right so if i'm gonna send a transaction which
25:45
is twenty to fifty dollars well you know i'm i'm paying a lot of money to send that transaction so for me i regard that
25:51
as a micro transaction and then obviously any transaction which is bigger than 20 to 50 dollars i would
25:58
this is just a normal transaction okay okay so um
26:03
okay considering that so you say that you know solana will be more helpful to reduce the amount of gas fees connect
26:10
right if companies are using it so i guess somewhere card i know also you know falls under that same category
26:17
right with low fees and you know higher compatibility what's a good card
26:25
i didn't hear your question what is the no like uh you you mentioned right like
26:30
solana is good for you know low gas fees for more microtransactions correct so somewhere i have read that cardano
26:37
actually also has similar low gas fees and you know it actually is very compatible with many transactions in the
26:43
similar setting right so uh how about card i know like how does that come into play
26:49
okay sure so when it comes to the whole uh okay so i think with cardano it's
26:54
probably more appropriate for d5 you know uh the decentralized finance
27:00
right yeah uh but right now i don't necessarily see it fitting well in with nfts and gaming and
27:09
the simple reason is because you need to think about when you create your game if you want your players to be selling those items on an exchange elsewhere
27:17
i don't know of any big exchange that is using uh cardano for nfts right but whereas at least open
27:25
c open c has already said that they're going to be using solana right
27:31
so that's that's another important thing i would consider if i was working with a project i was like okay what with what
27:36
blockchain you're using where are your players going to be able to buy and sell the nfts
27:42
right okay that's that's very perfect that's that's good um considering that
27:47
like um how how does machinations work like does mac nations have a currency of its own
27:53
or is it building on nfts like non-fungible tokens or you know fungible tokens like utility tokens how does uh
27:59
how is machinations working their community sure uh
28:04
so maca nations as a company as a whole we we don't have our own token we are a
28:10
limited company uh we're backed by a number of venture capitalists we had a recent fundraising ground
28:17
uh but for our customers that use our services uh for the ones in web three
28:23
i think uh quite a few of them they're using a binance chain solana and ethereum so it's a mix of
28:30
like those three because i know there's one project that we worked with which is called uh
28:36
the empire which is a card trading game uh and yeah i think what they're using is
28:42
solana nice okay so uh as much as i understand almost every kind of web 3 network is
28:49
compatible with imaginations correct like the design yeah yeah of course because machinations
28:55
is built on an object-based language which is known as a touring complete
29:00
language and touring complete language means if you think it you can model it
29:06
uh actually uh back at my other home i have a water bottle with uh with with
29:12
the diagram of machinations oh wow and and and that diagram is just
29:18
essentially uh refilling the the water bottle taking a sip of water which takes
29:24
uh 10 10 out and then when the value reaches obviously like uh zero it's time for
29:31
refill and the whole process starts again so actually for machinations you can use it almost for anything not just for gaming
29:37
like i imagine for the engineering world uh iot music
29:44
sorry like it's basically for understanding economy of everything right any business yeah yeah yeah yeah i i
29:52
mean at the moment we're just focused on gaming
30:03
absolutely yeah you have to focus your value on where is the most important right now and that's where we see our
30:08
value so yeah essentially if you've got any kind of blockchain game any system it
30:14
can be modeled big machinations oh that's definitely great so see like i
30:20
see that you know almost every kind of network or you know anyone who wants to develop even game design or any kind of
30:26
economy can use machinations right so uh i read that you have a you know a big community of 20 000 plus gamers right
30:33
and people for designing and developing so how uh did mac nations you know which started out in i guess 2016 right how
30:41
did uh magnesium start building their community like what uh what is the main essence of building a community what do
30:47
you think like if someone wants to build a community right now what are the steps they should take
30:52
yeah okay so that's that's uh quite a big question uh but machinations as a
30:59
company itself started five years ago uh and i know that process has just been
31:05
like step by step i saw i think for a lot of people out there you need to consider that if you really are working on a great uh
31:13
idea it's going to take time yeah things are not quick especially now
31:18
with the current market conditions you know people are more uh apprehensive to invest money the the
31:25
more afraid to try new things so i just say to the people out there use this
31:30
time to learn develop and refine the idea that you have so when the sun comes
31:37
out again you are ready to go yeah so so for growing the community it's
31:44
just about having a number of different platforms like twitter discord
31:50
uh i think these are probably some of the biggest in uh web three
31:55
those those two uh to have a media presence through like
32:00
youtube uh this this is also helpful uh and if you can create partnerships with with
32:07
different uh youtubers who can maybe do like a webinar almost like what we're doing now this is a opportunity to grow
32:14
your awareness get it and then obviously when you then have more money behind you and you have some
32:20
investment i think it's good to go to different uh gaming events in person
32:26
because what we do as a company now as we go to gaming events and there's a lot of value to be had there because that's
32:31
the opportunity where i can meet with uh other big projects and gaming studios
32:37
out there and they can learn a bit more about us we can learn a bit more about them
32:43
yeah all those processes right definitely that that's really you know helpful like in simple words if i
32:50
put it there you know it's basically if you add value to the community somewhere or the other at some point your
32:56
community will start building right so you keep on giving value to people who are using your product your
33:02
customers uh you go meet people who are in your industry it will definitely you know bring back the value that you are adding to the community okay
33:09
that is how it goes so uh here's an interesting question which i you know uh i believe uh
33:14
lots of companies face uh and i guess you might have also questioned yourself in doing that because you mentioned about your startup
33:21
you know how it got you know disintegrated because of various aspects correct so what i saw was uh mac nations
33:27
is actually working via seven cities okay and there's a very distributed network of uh people who are working in
33:33
the team right from various places so if someone wants to do team building right uh
33:40
what people they should consider how they can maintain a team which is working remotely okay how all of this
33:46
team structure team building can be managed and you know why am i asking you this is because one currently you know
33:52
you're working in back nation then it has a you know distributed network that is one of people who are working with and second you yourself as a founder
33:59
know what are the complications that come okay while building a startup as well by building a team as well while
34:05
keeping the team strong right so keeping it simple uh if a person is wanting to build a
34:12
startup okay how to maintain a team how to build a team okay what are your thought
34:18
processes what are your opinions on that yeah sure sure yeah so so definitely i
34:24
would say that there is no i in team yeah exactly uh if if you're working on
34:30
a project i've seen that happen before in my own startup don't think that you can do everything because you cannot do
34:36
everything because if you try to do everything then the value of everything becomes less
34:42
so you have a team to delegate things to and those people in the team they've all
34:48
got their own responsibilities so the first thing is you need to have accountability in your team because if
34:54
if you don't make things clear in your team with who is doing what and when it
35:00
needs to be done then what's going to happen is first of all things are not going to get done
35:05
uh second of all people are going to lose motivation because when things are not being done the whole momentum of
35:12
what you're working on just doesn't progress you know it it stops
35:17
and then maybe for some other people that are very happy and motivated to work on their own without a target in
35:25
mind they will then start to see that the other people are not pulling their weight and then they will become
35:31
frustrated they will become angry and then you get all sorts of problems so i
35:36
think the first thing is you need to have accountability and uh clear communication
35:42
and if you are using different platforms like now what we're using is slack i find
35:48
slack is really good i actually feel bad that i didn't use slack that much before i i was trying to
35:56
go to google uh but for me slack is much better because it's very easy to reference a certain
36:04
conversation and talk about a topic okay that that sounds pretty decent
36:09
right like uh you should obviously acknowledge the efforts of your teammates that accounts for
36:14
accountability and take the team ahead like i i suppose everyone who is in web 3 right now has heard the term wag me
36:22
it's it's always we are all gonna make it it's not i am you know gonna make it correct so let's root for that that's
36:28
definitely uh so this brings to the you know uh the end of our you know the whole webinar that we you know planned
36:34
today um before we end we have a few questions from the community itself which uh you know uh our team at
36:41
trekkirum have found out and let's start with that and then we'll go into the conclusion process works so let's have
36:47
the first question for what the community has for you okay okay
36:53
how can mcnations add value to blockchain gaming
37:00
machinations can add value to blockchain gaming because we can bring credibility
37:06
and verification to the web three games because right now there's not a lot of
37:13
clarity on what is a scam and what isn't yeah yeah i know they're quite bluntly but
37:20
essentially people are nervous about where they put their money so i think machinations has a program which
37:28
is called verified by machinations it's a service that we offer and what we
37:34
will do is we will design your game test your game and through that process
37:39
if everything looks fine we will obviously give you feedback if there's a problem with the game
37:45
but the point is that's an opportunity for you to to refine and develop your idea
37:50
and also to make your idea credible because if you are if what you're
37:56
working on is credible then to have the community support to
38:01
have in investment all those things are going to be much easier so that's that's a really good value to
38:08
be had right and i suppose you know in the um current running bear markets okay
38:16
company should actually you know try using products like micronations to understand what they currently need to do to
38:22
maintain their economy right so why are like why don't you tell me like
38:28
how different companies can right now you know even use uh machinations to
38:33
maintain their economy in the current markets in the current market
38:39
yeah yeah absolutely uh so machinations when we do the the
38:45
modeling of your game it's not just like okay we've taken a model of your game which is like a screenshot in time and
38:50
then that's it see you later good luck no our uh verification service that we
38:58
offer is a ongoing commitment so we will actually continue to monitor
39:04
your game and if there's any issues we might then advise and say uh you know such and such token or
39:11
mechanic isn't looking good because of abc so you should
39:17
therefore consider this because like i'll give you an example uh axi infinity
39:23
we actually have a model maxi infinity in machinations uh and it's very easy to see why this
39:30
game and the economy is flawed because the game just has inflation
39:37
and the inflation and the inflation that it has is reliant on new people coming in to the game and
39:44
not taking the money out but as soon as some people take money out then there's a big imbalance between
39:51
okay the volume running yeah yeah
39:57
exactly okay so if they were to design the game better then what they would have would be some drain mechanics
40:05
because we need to think of it like applicable to our world right now right now on our world we have a lot of
40:12
inflation we have inflation because the source yeah i'm talking in machia
40:18
nation's language here the source which is the banks have printed a lot of money
40:23
out of thin air and there wasn't a drain for that money
40:29
so where did that money go that money went into the pools the pools you know property gas food so the price of those
40:36
things are going up yeah oh wow so that's all like a real world
40:41
world example of inflation and in games you have inflation and deflation that's the same kind of
40:48
principles get it same kind of economy is done over here as well
40:53
right very like very distinctively put like i actually didn't think it this way um but thanks for that alexander okay um
41:01
let's move on to the next question let's see what what is the next question that we have
41:10
yeah how does pricing work on you know machinations like how what is the pricing structure
41:17
yeah sure so i think i will actually share my screen for this so it's easy to see
41:40
okay uh can you see things yes yes
41:45
yeah essentially there are two main options you have you can do a self-service
41:52
option or you can do our verified service so i will start explaining the self-service so the self-service option
41:59
you can start the community plan which is free uh your diagrams they are public so
42:05
other people can see them there can only be one editor and only three days of history is stored
42:11
then the next plan the diagram is public it's 59 a month
42:17
you have a unlimited amount of editors so you can share it with your whole team there's faster simulations
42:24
the history of the diagram stays for 20 days you sync with google sheets and there's
42:29
a unity plugin and api and we are also working on a unreal uh engine plug-in
42:36
and api right now that's going to be ready in the next three months and then the next plan is the
42:43
professional which uh just gives you essentially a longer storage history faster
42:48
simulations you get an account manager and an onboarding process uh and then we
42:54
will work with you if you've got any questions we will help you there as a support and if you're a very
43:01
big project then we have a custom plan where we can give you uh training one to
43:06
one so that's that's the plans that we have when it comes to self-service and all plans
43:14
include a 14-day trial in the trial we we do not take any credit card
43:19
information nothing like that so what i would recommend to everyone is you actually try the 14 day trial and
43:27
the majority of people do go with this plan which is 59 a month
43:32
and we and actually with anyone that's listening to this call as well if if you do sign up for the 14-day trial uh
43:40
then i can try to arrange for you a demonstration with one of the other people in my team
43:47
and they can just you know just just run through with you how machinations works
43:52
yeah so that's one option now the other option is actually verified by machinations so i'm just
43:58
going to give that up for you
44:03
so with this plan this is more of a service
44:08
uh and i'm just letting you know that this service that we offer here it's it's not
44:13
for everyone because the thing is this this plan is more expensive
44:19
uh and what we're actually doing is we're using the our team to build a model of your game and all that we
44:26
need from you is we need a up-to-date gdd and a gdd is again design
44:32
documentation so if you have your game design documentation ready
44:38
then essentially we can take what you have in words and we can translate that into a diagram
44:45
and machinations and we can do the testing of your game but the whole idea is we build and maintain a healthy game
44:51
economy right because in the highly uncertain sector of play to earn
44:56
uh and andals and amms which is automatic or market makers
45:03
these things add a lot of complexity and we're just testing these things to make sure that what you're working on as a
45:08
game is uh secure it's safe and the economy isn't going to blow up
45:14
so we model systems personas and scenarios i can talk about personas if
45:20
we still have some time we predict economy outcomes and you can get it verified by machination seal
45:27
so you can use this seal with your white paper documentation you can show this to investors you can
45:33
share this with your community uh and i know that for the projects that have used us
45:39
having this sale does improve their uh their their image and their presence
45:46
which obviously means if you're going to be raising more money it it it can help with that and then there's a live ops
45:54
so that's what i mean by an ongoing commitment so essentially we will work with you
45:59
every month we will always be testing any new content before it goes into production
46:06
and we will review the economy because we have uh we have apis and plugins so we can
46:13
monitor things and we can give you reviews and so if there's any issue that's coming up in your game we can
46:18
communicate that to you these are the projects we've actually worked with already so we've got mummy i o star origins
46:25
honeylands i'm just talking about a few of the big ones here blast royale
46:31
this is like an fps game at the citadel this is a spaceship game which has got like our rts elements to it
46:39
uh and also here is a mavia if you search on youtube machinations heroes of media we have a webinar with heroes of
46:46
avia so you can see the value that we brought to them as a project
46:51
uh and also we've got the empire so i mentioned this earlier this is a card game
46:57
on web3 and the value that they found with us is by using the
47:02
verified by machination service in their card game they had two main uh playing decks
47:10
before you go into all the combinations and one of the playing decks there was a 54 chance that you would win
47:16
now any kind of card game it should be 50 50. so by working with us they were able to
47:22
then change the decks and make it fair for the players so yeah that's essentially the two
47:28
services you've got a self-service or you've got um this this other service and if you want
47:34
you're interested in the service you can just go here and click verify my game fill the form in
47:40
and then we will be in contact with you
47:45
okay yes hi
47:50
so yeah that that sounds pretty amazing like the whole pricing plan i i feel it's very decent enough for you know all
47:57
kinds of uh users even if it's a company it's an individual how they can use machinations right um i see you uh you
48:04
know spoke out something called as personas right so just two questions um so we
48:10
will talk about personas here okay uh like yeah we have a question already can you tell us about different gamer
48:15
personas and second we'll go about uh investing okay after that so let's first
48:21
go with personas let's go ahead yeah yeah yeah yeah sure sure okay i'll just uh quickly share my
48:27
screen again then right screen yeah sure
48:35
okay so this is the nine types of blockchain gamers it's some research published by navic uh navic do work with
48:43
us and i know they work with a few other big projects out there uh essentially
48:48
how crypto is different is because in traditional gaming you you just have this side the players
48:55
yeah in web 3 we introduced two new big stakeholders which are
49:02
earners and investors so in a web 3 game it's very complex
49:07
because like people we in people we have different personalities in gaming you also have
49:14
different personalities and those personalities will have different playing behavior and that playing
49:19
behavior has an effect on the economy of that game so for example with a axi infinity you
49:26
have the workers maybe the workers they are in india uh thailand indonesia philippines
49:33
like wherever and and they are earning maybe 15 a day so
49:39
whatever money that they they earn from the game they actually take it out of the game yeah
49:44
and then you've got other people that are earnest which are silent investors so maybe they have bought some tokens in
49:51
the game uh and they're just waiting for the value to go up
49:56
you have markets speculated so maybe the market speculators what they're doing is they're trying to buy the top and sell
50:02
the bottom and they're just trying to make like a a quick profit and then you've obviously got the
50:07
players so maybe for these players they they don't care that much about earning money from the game but what they do
50:14
care about is the engagement and fun of a game uh and then you have the investors so
50:21
obviously for the investors these are very different so the entrepreneurs the entrepreneurs are going to be like the
50:27
founders of of a project uh the early adopters maybe they
50:33
they uh through their network they find out who the entrepreneur is
50:38
and they support the project at an early stage and then you have the crypto whales so obviously they buy a large amount of
50:44
tokens in the beginning when it's a very cheap price so the point is all these different uh
50:50
stakeholders they are going to have a different impact on the game
50:56
yeah and you can read more into the detail here about how each of these work
51:02
so like an early adopter for example it says they might have a comparable fund
51:08
liquidity volume to that of crypto wales but they get to know about our project early and do their research well
51:14
yeah so the point is you if you're building a game
51:19
and you want it to be balanced then you should be aware of these different playing personas
51:25
uh and at machinations we obviously take this into account if we design any uh economy for someone
51:32
okay that sounds pretty amazing okay awesome so this this brings me to
51:38
the last question that you know i have like i've seen you like my connections as a team has you know
51:45
taken a lot of you know investments in funding from various uh institutions they'll be private even government
51:50
institutions as well right so how uh should a person who is wanting to
51:56
build in web 3 or even you know in the current scenarios how uh a team should go in a step-by-step
52:03
process to take investment from you know uh people like investors and vcs so what
52:09
do you think is a process that you might have followed and worked out for you which people can even you know take me
52:14
on yeah yeah absolutely uh okay so if you're gonna when you're starting off
52:19
like really early on because i went through this process as well okay uh you'd be looking for grants
52:26
because maybe the grants you can get is a thousand dollars five thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars some grants go up
52:32
to a hundred thousand yeah so for example if you're gonna be working with polygon matic i know that they have a
52:37
process where you can submit your application and you can get a grant from them so really when you start off unless
52:44
you're gonna be using your own money then you you should be applying for grants where you can and normally what
52:50
these grants they ask is a white paper uh a kind of pitch deck
52:57
so the other thing is if so so the later stage after you do these things you will need a pitch deck to show to
53:04
venture capitalists uh angel investors because for angel investors and venture
53:09
capitalists what they care about is not so much your white paper i mean your white paper is
53:15
still important but for them what is more important is a pitch deck and if you don't have a pitch deck then
53:21
you need to make one because it it's very important
53:27
yeah sounds amazing so like basically everyone should start with grants and then they need to you know go into the
53:33
first round of investments with proper uh strategy correct
53:39
yeah yeah yeah absolutely and it will obviously help if you've got someone that has gone through that process
53:44
before who can act as your consultant advisor um
53:50
and that's also going to help you your credibility and your credibility is very important right right thank you like um
53:58
this this was really great you know like um the whole one that we have spent in talking about various concepts here not
54:04
even gaming we went to business and then we came around gaming and how gamers are there then we spoke about what kind of
54:10
games you know um you loved while you were a child you know a kid and how that
54:16
brought up you from becoming a business from business to you know game design as well right so what do you think you know
54:22
like alexander how do you feel about the whole one-hour session that we have any you know insights that you want to give
54:29
that um how it felt how it felt working with team requiem with me
54:34
anything you want to say any conclusion last thoughts yeah yeah i i would say i quite
54:39
enjoyed this because uh they always say that when you are a teacher you also are a learner so as i'm
54:46
explaining these things i'm also refining my knowledge
54:53
so so it's it's helpful for me to uh again obviously when you ask these questions it's a good opportunity for me
55:00
to develop what what already i know yeah
55:05
so how was it working with the team like team recording like how does it feel working with them
55:12
yeah well well i i just started working with the with with you guys obviously we have the webinar today and i i like this format
55:20
it's it's quite nice like i see certainly it felt very decent
55:26
it feels like a normal a one-on-one conversation that we had right it felt very decent very simple
55:32
very a smooth flow uh how about you like was it good like any questions you want to you know put forth
55:39
yeah yeah yeah exactly like i i mirror what you said when i find it easy it's a flow
55:44
and i think that's how it should be because if you've got someone that's uh talking all the time and then no one
55:50
asking any questions then it's maybe it's gonna feel like a fake and scripted
55:56
i don't have any scripts today yeah you know
56:02
you you just ask me some questions and then i talk about it and try not to ramble too much
56:07
because i don't want to watch it so it should be as simple as the machination software interactive yet
56:13
amusing yeah sometimes uh less is more
56:19
right exactly that's that's true so thank you so much alexander you know for coming on board and you know uh
56:26
telling talking to you know me and the community about uh how mac nation is actually you know taking the lead in
56:33
changing the course of understanding systems okay on understanding economies and understanding about building
56:38
economies right so thank you for having uh taking our time and coming here uh i
56:45
really hope everyone who listens to this okay gains a lot of knowledge not only on around game design but also on
56:52
different aspects on building a startup working with a team okay and how to choose their career also
56:59
right like you did it started off with business but now you're doing something that you love right so definitely i hope
57:05
uh it brings a lot of exposure to everyone here like i literally as a person have learned learned a lot okay
57:12
and i hope everyone here also does any last thoughts any ending notes
57:20
uh yeah which as i was saying as i said earlier use this current time
57:25
with what's going on in the market look crypto you have bear markets bull markets just like you have seasons in a
57:31
year you have winter summer spring or maybe in in india you have you know a rainy season dry season the point is
57:38
life is cycles life is growth decay change so just use this time right
57:44
now to develop and refine your ideas so when the next cycle comes you are ready to go
57:52
bam right exactly awesome thank you so much alexander uh loved having you here
57:58
let's end this conversation thank you all right thank you take care everyone
58:04
take care thank you goodbye well great thank you so much all of you for joining us today it it was a you
58:11
know a great learning for what happened uh and throughout the session
58:16
how we learned how different uh you know companies and even game development you know ecosystems can know when their
58:23
economies are going to you know work well or when the economies are gonna you know they are basically boom or burst
58:30
right so that is definitely something which had a great amount of experience and learning that we gained from today
58:36
and i'm sure you had fun throughout the evening learning about alexander
58:41
how we were how he worked on you know imaginations with the marketing team how he ended up working with them starting
58:49
with a background from business and jumping into you know game development consulting yeah in building economies so
58:56
definitely it was a really great you know uh experience that i had and i definitely hope you also had the same
59:03
okay uh it is my immense pla with immense pleasure i tell you that it was great hosting alexander as well as you
59:10

Jesse Walden: Fundraising and Deal Structure
(source: https://youtu.be/jNbPriRubUs?si=URTDz5OyAGnGvtgU)


Introduction
0:01
[Music]
0:20
hi everyone I'm Jessie Walden I'm on the team at Andreessen Horowitz program managing crypto startup school and prior
0:27
was a founder of media chain a project in the space and so today I'm going to
0:32
talk about considerations that crypto startups need to think through with regard to fundraising and deal structure
Startup Financing
0:39
and there's going to be a lot here that that riffs on Brian's presentation first
0:44
off what is what is startup financing all about and this is not just crypto this is just startup financing in
0:51
general it's all about converting financial capital into production capital and what that means is financial
0:59
capital is an investment of money use to hire people and to build products and
1:05
services and production capital is the value of those products and services once built and so again this is true of
1:14
both crypto startups and traditional ones but a key difference between crypto and traditional startups is that the
1:21
productive kept the production capital in crypto networks comes from a community of contributors not only the
1:28
core team and that has some pretty big implications so in my earlier talk in
1:35
the program on progressive decentralization you guys heard about the three sequential objectives for
1:42
crypto startups the first is to build a product people want the second is to
1:47
build a community around that product and hopefully some one with some network effects and the third is to give
1:53
ownership to the community and in that talk I saw it stated that the first two
2:00
objectives are the same for crypto projects and traditional startups both
2:05
need to build a product that people want they need to get users and hopefully build the community around it but it's
2:10
the third objective giving ownership to the community where crypto starts to diverge a little bit by giving ownership
2:17
to the community community members have a strong incentive to participate in generating the production capital of a
2:24
network Bitcoin and aetherium for example of both built very vibrant communities of miners that operate the
2:30
network in exchange for Bitcoin and youth respectively and this has obviously been a very effective way
2:36
to bootstrap those networks what's different about fundraising in crypto so
2:41
as you can see on the top here traditional startups grow by raising funding through a series of financing
2:49
rounds this enables them to hire more people to expand their products and services and effectively transform
2:55
financial capital into production capital and ultimately revenues that drive investment returns and crypto
3:03
startups being community owned follow a slightly different trajectory so the
3:08
early stages again they look similar build a product build a community but at
3:14
the point you've done that you you start to move into community ownership and operation mode and so how this plays out
3:22
in fundraising could be that you know a crypto startup raises financial capital in a seed or subsequent early rounds
3:28
hires a great team builds a great product builds a community around that product product and then once there's
3:36
sufficient community involvement starts to invite the community to participate in ownership and operation and so what
3:42
that means is that subsequent growth for a crypto startup both in the form of
3:47
financial and production capital comes from the community itself who has a
3:53
direct economic incentive to ensure that growth of the network over time now the
3:59
fact that crypto startups aim for community ownership has further implications for deal structure so so
4:05
let's get into that how should crypto founder founders structure deals
4:11
well again given that the early stages of a crypto startup tend to be pretty similar to a traditional one at a 16 Z
4:18
we tend to think that the the best instrument to fundraise is still equity in a company and and I know in Brian's
4:25
talk we talked about this exciting new membership model and we think that has a lot of promise but what's what's tested
4:31
and true is equity in a company and so first off why is equity the choice instrument for first startup fundraising
4:37
in general well it's because equity facilitates long term alignment between
4:43
the founders that and investors so you know whatever the company ends up doing whether it needs
4:49
to pivot investors are aligned for that long haul by owning equity in the
4:54
company and and crucially this means that there's no obligation for a crypto
5:02
company to produce a token and that just wasn't true for icos or token pre-sales
5:08
that we saw in in some in the earlier days in the space where the promise very much was to deliver a token and as we
5:17
know now committing to a token upfront can be a distraction from finding the perfect way to achieve product market
5:23
fit so where flexibility is critical especially in the early stages of a startup equity is is the best way to
5:31
achieve that alignment and flexibility that founders need but if the goal of a
5:36
crypto startup is to produce a network that's owned and operated by a large community of users all over the world
5:42
then a token being natively digital is likely the best instrument to coordinate
5:47
it once a team is ready because it's a lot harder to do as a security as you
5:52
heard in Brian's talk so when it comes to deal structure it's critical to
5:57
figure out what happens to tokens if and when the founding team builds a network that generates them and so the way that
6:06
we've structured many deals is as an equity purchase in a company but one that comes with rights to tokens so that
6:13
as if the team builds a product or network that produces token a token then
6:18
the the investors will receive some of those tokens in proportion to their
6:24
ownership stake in the company and just like equity aligns investors with
6:29
founders in a company this token right aligns investors with founders and teams
6:34
if the company builds a decentralized network coordinated by a token and again
6:40
the key stone here is that investors will receive their proportional share relative to what the founders and the
6:46
core team received at the time of distribution now remember crypto
6:52
networks was meant to be community owned and operated so it can't be the case that founders and investors on all of the tokens so what about them
6:59
where does the community's ownership stake come in well this brings up the
7:04
question of dilution so to understand dilation let's let's go back to our
7:09
slide on fundraising trajectories in a traditional startup early founders
7:16
employees and investors are diluted as the company takes on subsequent rounds
7:21
of financing and what I mean by that is that as as the company goes through these rounds of fundraising from seed to
7:28
A to B to see new shares in the company are actually created they're inflating
7:34
and those new shares are sold to new investors so this means the ownership percentages of founders early team
7:41
members and early investors gets smaller as subsequent rounds of financing are raised
7:46
so that's dilution but why do teens and investors agree to that well the reason
7:54
is that more financial capital coming into the company allows the company to
7:59
grow its production capital so to expand its products and services hire more people and as the production capital
8:06
grows the pie gets bigger for everyone so while the early team and investors
8:12
may own less in percentage terms their ownership stake can be more valuable and that's why they agree to dilution so the
8:22
same logic holds for crypto networks crypto networks raise financial capital
8:27
to build production capital in the form of a product or network that they plan to hopefully progressively decentralize
8:34
and by giving community members a stake in the network early founders and
8:39
investors have a new tool to fuel growth and network effects that grow the pipe so community members contribute to the
8:46
ongoing operation and success and so it follows that it's in the interest of roli founders and investors to take on
8:52
some dilution from the community in order to grow the size of the pie overall so to make this more concrete
Seed Round Example
8:59
let's walk through a specific example so here's a very simple example of a seed
9:06
round let's say $1,000,000 is in tested in exchange for 20% of the equity
9:12
in a company and this values the company at five million dollars now let's say
9:17
the company plans to launch a network and the goal of this network is to be decentralized or community owned and
9:22
operated so an allocation to the community needs to be considered and decided upon now just for illustration let's say the
9:32
core team decides that the community will receive 50% of all the tokens in
9:37
this network which leaves the company and investors with the other 50% of tokens while deciding on that specific
9:45
distribution is important because it has an implications for the valuation of the network and here's how so remember that
9:53
1 million into the company gives investors 20% of equity in that company
9:59
and when the company goes on to build this network the community will get 50%
10:04
of its tokens and the investors will get the other 50% so that means that the investors pro rata or proportional share
10:11
of the network is 10% that's 50% of their 20% in the company so where 1
10:20
million dollars buys 20% of equity at a 5 million dollar valuation for the company that same 1 million dollars buys
10:27
only 10% of tokens which implies a network valuation of double that of the
10:33
company or 10 million and to make that even more clear let's see what happens to your network valuation when founders
10:39
decide they're going to give 75 percent of network tokens to the community so as
10:45
you can see here now the the core team and early investors would again be cut
10:51
in half the same 1 million dollars that bought 20% of the company is now only buying 5 percent of the tokens because
10:59
the community has the other 75% so hopefully you can see and build an
11:04
intuition now that the valuation for the network is dependent upon the amount of
11:09
dilution penciled in for the community which again is a function of the total supply of tokens and how they get
11:15
distributed over time so given that you know you probably can tell that the
11:22
future token distribution to community members is closely related to ownership
11:28
dilution for the core team and early investors and accordingly it's really important to have a good plan for how
11:34
that token distribution to the community is going to work and who the the stakeholders are so a few key takeaways
11:42
to note about do structure first is that equity with rights for tokens is a great
11:50
way to align founders and investors for the long term that it takes to build a product build a community and eventually
11:56
turn ownership over to that community via tokens and again this this structure it adds a lot of flexibility to founders
12:04
to figure out the best way to achieve product market fit without mandating that they necessarily produce a token to
12:10
do it and a keystone of this structure is that token rights give founders and
12:18
investors alignment on some dilution plan for the community but by giving
12:24
community members that stake in the network early founders and investors are leveraging this new tool for community
12:30
growth and network effects that traditional syrups haven't really played with to date and so that's a really
12:38
exciting new tool but it's important to plan what that token distribution looks like in advance so that both founders
12:44
and investors know what their respective ownership stakes and the networks are going to be in the long run and finally
12:51
the last takeaway well it's it's sorry it's it's what I just said it's is that
12:57
token distribution should be considered upfront in order to reason about the team and investors long-term ownership
13:03
stake and I guess it's good that I'm reiterating that a second time because it's that's a that's a crucial point
13:08
when it comes to fundraising so let's let's dig in on that a little bit more
Network Monetary Policy
13:14
and and this brings up the topic of network monetary policy so there's no
13:21
one-size-fits-all monetary policy in crypto networks that dictates what the supply of tokens or ownership stakes
13:27
will be this is all very dependent on the type of network that you're launching the various stakeholders
13:33
involve and how you incentivize them to contribute but we can run we could talk about a few examples so of course most
13:41
famous is Bitcoin where the code specifies that there will only be over 21 million tokens in circulation and
13:48
those tokens are distributed each block to miners on a predefined schedule as a reward for contributing work to the
13:54
network so that's a very simple monetary policy and it's easy to reason about
14:00
ones ownership stake in the network because there's a predefined number of tokens but other networks such as the
14:06
theorem they don't have a thick supply and instead have a perpetually inflating monetary support oaken supply so tokens
14:14
and a theorem are continually minted to reward ongoing active participation of the miners in the network and so in the
14:22
case of a network like aetherium if token supply is always growing then it seems as though founders and investors
14:29
would be perpetually diluted losing ownership over time now in the case of aetherium that that that is actually
14:35
true but in other networks it's not always the case so some networks have perpetual
14:42
inflation that can actually be productive in the sense that capital assets in the network or tokens in that
14:48
network can be put to productive use by by staking so let's look at that so in
Proof of Stake
14:56
proof of stake networks like solo or Forte token owners can actually stake
15:02
their bond their assets as a bond that secures they work the work that they do to can to keep the network operational
15:08
if they do a bad job those tokens can get programmatically taken away that's that's proof of stake and this means
15:17
that an investor or token owner can stake their tokens in the network in order to make them productive and when
15:24
multiple investors and token owners do this the result is a live functioning
15:29
decentralized network so token owners become the network operators and in
15:34
exchange for their work the network mints new tokens and rewards them so
15:40
here is inflation and it may be perpetual but it's non diluted since the
15:47
that are making their tokens productive in the network are able to earn those inflationary rewards increasing their
15:53
the number of tokens that they own while the supply of tokens continues to inflate so so here their ownership stays
16:00
the same so long as they participate and and this is why raising capital from
16:05
those native to the crypto ecosystem can be really advantageous to founders because number one they understand that
16:12
community ownership in operation is critical to the success of these networks and with an effective network
16:19
monetary policy these investors are highly incentivized to become active community members in order to maintain
16:25
their ownership stake in the network and increase their returns as the service grows so with that kind of
Sources of Capital
16:33
specialization in mind I think want to wrap up with a look at the different
16:38
sources for capital in the ecosystem and and how they compare so yeah there's there's been a bit of an evolution of
16:45
financial capital available to crypto startups crowdfunding was the most
16:51
popular way for crypto stirrups to raise funding from 2014 to 2017 18 or so and
16:57
during that period we saw many of the top 10 crowdfunding events in history play out as icos
17:03
and that's that's probably because the ability to distribute packets of value
17:09
in the form of tokens made investing in new startups as fast and as easy as
17:14
sending an email and that's just never been the case before and and while crowdfunding can be a great way to build
17:20
a community we know from Brian's talk that it comes with a host of regulatory
17:25
considerations and dealing with those issues and the complexity of managing a large liquid token distribution can be a
17:32
distraction from managing product development and achieving product market fit so super important to weigh the
17:39
trade-offs of raising money from the crowd verse focusing on building a product but the the crowdfunding model
17:49
is still one that is exciting and and the membership model that Brian Brooks talked about is a possible path forward
17:55
for that that that we look forward to seeing more information on seeing around the same
18:02
time that the ico boom hit its peak we started to see the emergence of another form of capital available to crypto
18:08
startups and that that was coming from crypto hedge funds so a number of hedge funds got raised and typically hedge
18:16
funds focus on training liquid assets and that's because their investors that
18:22
investors in hedge funds typically are focused on short-term returns that you
18:28
get from trading and and that's manifest in the lock-up period for capital invested in hedge funds which tends to
18:34
range from monthly to quarterly or sometimes yearly redemptions so this
18:42
shorter time horizon can lead to some sort of unstable alignment between core
18:48
teams and in bet and hedge funds in that it takes time to build a product and the
18:54
community and ultimately to exit to that community and investors who are focused on short term returns short term trading
19:01
may not be able to or willing to stick around through volatile markets and and
19:07
all the time that it takes to bring the product to fruition and so finally that
19:13
that gave rise to another form of capital for for crypto networks and that is crypto focused VC and like
19:20
traditional VC crypto theses tend to have committed capital which means their
19:25
investors are locked up for ten years or thereabout so with that capital
19:31
committed over the long term crypto VCS are much more capable of being aligned
19:36
with founders for however long it takes to build and launch a network and and
19:42
ultimately turn it over to the community to own and further you know
19:49
specialization goes a long way to figuring out you know the appropriate valuation methodology the appropriate
19:56
deal structure to structure the the unique sort of equity deal with token
20:01
rights and furthermore you know crypto dedicated VCS have capabilities to
20:07
participate in networks custody tokens do this sort of more technical that that crypto networks require
20:14
because as community owned and operated networks they depend on on their their
20:19
early investors and community members to bootstrap the network so specialization goes a long way and that's something to
20:26
optimize for so with that a few quick takeaways number one it's important to
Takeaways
20:33
understand how crypto fundraising is different from traditional start start up fundraising northstar is to exit to
20:39
the community by giving the community ownership and inviting their active participation in operating and growing
20:45
the network and so it's important to have a really clear plan for transitioning the community to that
20:52
ownership and participation model and you know we think that raising equity with an option for tokens is the best
20:58
structure for aligning founders and investors early on through this journey of progressively centralizing the
21:04
product or service to a community on network and finally your your early
21:11
community including investors play a crucial role in achieving this and so you need to make sure as you're going
21:18
and thinking about fundraising how do you optimize your fund rates for a community that is long-term aligned and
21:26
and so with that I'm gonna open it up to Q&A and Allie I think is graciously
21:32
gonna help me moderate the question so I can focus on answering them so only if
21:37
you're out there shoot those questions over awesome Thank You Jessie cool well
Questions
21:43
the first question here is from James and it reads as follows so let's say that a company builds a great product
21:50
and a strong community and then successfully launches a decentralized network powered by a token can you talk
21:56
about what things look like for that original company afterwards who should be responsible for the mobile app that
22:03
was the original product the mobile apps cannot be maintained in a decentralized way should this be operated by a new company
22:09
and if so what should the funding and business model look like for that company yeah that's a that's a really
22:15
good set of questions so so yeah there's the way that I think about it is you
22:22
know the company that launches the network has you know maybe let's say they built
22:28
full-stack as in James example and and I think compound is a really good example of this where they both built a smart
22:33
contract and they built the first user interface which could be the mobile app and James example they once the network
22:41
is live and running hopefully it becomes decentralized through multiple community members
22:47
contributing to it and building on top of it and in that scenario the mobile app that they've built is just one of n
22:53
or one of many mobile apps sitting on top of this this network or smart contract and so the business model for
23:02
the company and the business model for the network start to diverge here right there's there's hopefully a business
23:08
model at the network level which could be maybe a fee taken in a marketplace
23:13
and then there's also a business model at the application layer and that could be different that could be an additional
23:20
fee on top of that charge by this more contract it could be advertising it could be anything
23:25
and so there that divergence in monetization is a big deal and it's
23:32
something that founders of the company need to consider which one that they want to prioritize it may be the case that just by virtue of owning some some
23:41
tokens in the network that company is sustainable as it sees fees coming out
23:46
of the network and and hopefully growth in those fees as more community members contribute to it so that could be one
23:52
viable model for the company and its investors is to just focus on making the tokens more valuable by say empowering
23:58
third-party developers and and and then that once that's the case they could
24:05
also build out a product team on top that that implements this other business model at the client level fantastic so
Norms
24:13
the next question here is from Paul what is your best guess for how soon you'll have a norm for the right community
24:20
ownership fraction do you imagine that once that stabilizes then that normal persists just like how that 4-year
24:27
vesting schedule became so standardized in traditional startups yeah it's a great question you know I think it's
24:33
gonna be highly dependent on the network and and it's application so for
24:40
something like Bitcoin which aims to be a non-sovereign store value I think it's
24:46
really important that it's it's extremely community owned right meaning it's the most decentralized ownership
24:51
you you can imagine because that gives it it's it the trust guarantees that for for an application like non-sovereign
24:58
store value that that make it valuable in the first place so so but but other
25:06
networks that are sort of you know maybe less paranoid about decentralization and
25:11
just want to meritocratic aliy reward folks for contribution you can imagine a very different distribution maybe one
25:18
that more fairly reflects the the degree to which you know community members are contributing over time versus the the
25:24
value that the core team has created at the outset so I don't think to answer
25:29
the question directly I don't think there is yet a precedent set for this but but certainly you know I think it
25:37
will emerge over time and it will likely be standardized relative to the type of application or networking question yeah
Monetary Policy
25:45
and his leg leads was to depend on the specific like monetary policy that the network has with the amount of inflation
25:51
that it has over time Bret Hart is sort of have like a single kind of one-size-fits-all solution upfront yeah
25:59
yeah exactly you need to really need to consider who are all the stakeholders what is the value of their contribution
26:05
and how does it play out over time and design the network's monetary policy to to best reward those efforts the next
Networks
26:14
question is from both Stefan and Paul how should founders think about networks
26:20
a networks concentration and how it impacts decentralization versus ability
26:25
to fundraise and how can founders protect themselves and the retail community against aggressive token sales
26:31
from investors that could hurt the credibility of this base in the long term
26:37
hmm well I think you know well Bryan
26:42
Brooks model that he proposed earlier I think is a really interesting thing to bring up again here I think it it points
26:51
to a way to conduct a crowd sale that that really like aligns all the
26:57
participants in this network or in a network I should say in a in a really
27:03
useful way so you know you do benefit from you know speculation is a powerful tool people wanting to profit is a
27:10
powerful incentive to get a network going and so but you want to do it in a
27:16
sort of responsible way and I think you know limiting membership to those folks
27:21
that are you know defined in a useful way people who can actually participate or contribute that's one way to mitigate
27:28
some of the risks that we saw in in sort of the Wild West of ICO crowdfunding so
27:34
I'm excited about about that I think that answers the second part of the question the first part remind me again
27:40
it's a it's about the the problem that concentration and the network poses the
Decentralization
27:46
question of decentralization is very centralized is that was that / - credibility of the space does that also
27:53
impact the ability to fundraise that there's a trade-off between yeah so so
27:59
yeah I think I think there there is a trade-off whether it hurts the project or not I think again depends on the
28:07
application in question so it may not be the case that all projects need to be
28:13
extremely decentralized it could be that some startups in the space tend to have
28:19
you know stronger leadership and maybe you're sort of more product focused and leave those products as such but then
28:27
have a vibrant community of contributors that that gets some ownership but not all right and that could be an
28:33
acceptable way to operate one of these networks so long as you're very transparent about that but then others
28:39
that require high degrees of trust they will require much more decentralization in order for all the participants to
28:46
feel as if you know they have control they have a say and there not some overarching you know oligopoly
28:53
that that will topple their interest so again I think it really depends on the application but decentralization
28:59
maximalism I think is useful for a certain class of applications but maybe not for all allowing these in lines what
Lockups
29:07
what are your thoughts on like things like lock ups and air drops as a way of managing a community and ensuring that
29:13
they stay aligned over the long term yeah so I think I think lock ups are a
29:19
great tool very common in start-up equity you Wester tokens over time often
29:26
it's the case that when a company goes public and equity get gets liquid
29:32
employees are locked up and investors are locked up and and and that's useful
29:37
because it means those with with insider information and so into how the product or service works aren't you know able to
29:44
dump those equities or tokens in the case of crypto networks on unknowing investors who are just sort of finding
29:50
out information from from the company day one so yeah I think I think lock ups can be a very powerful tool investing
29:57
and can be about a powerful tool that we take from the equity world into the token world and you know it there's new
30:05
ways to do it which are which are interesting like the perpetual inflation is a great way to keep contributors
30:12
active over time right so if you don't participate in a network and you just let your tokens sit there and the
30:19
network is perpetually inflating you get diluted so that's that's sort of a similar way of you know achieving the
30:25
same ends of keeping people committed to the network and so there's some new new ways to explore this concept of lock ups
30:33
that have a similar effect what about what about air drops yeah air drops well
Airdrops
30:40
I think air drops are an effective way to to make the transition from you know
30:47
traditional product team and start up to community ownership and especially so
30:53
once you have users actually using the product or service because at the point that you know you have usage and to
31:00
analyze you can really start to think about who's contributing value and then reward them through an airdrop so
31:07
that's that's a pretty powerful tool and in my talk on on progressive decentralization I sort of you know
31:14
discuss the idea that you could do some sort of a promissory way so for example running a test net program where you
31:21
tell folks hey if you you know participate in the network early and run this test net when the main network goes
31:27
live you'll receive some some tokens in the Genesis block which is similar to to
31:33
an airdrop so I think that can be a really effective way to sort of make the transition to community ownership the
Defenseability
31:41
next question is from Stefan how important is for protection or defense
31:47
ability to fundraising yeah that's a good question
31:52
well so this this goes back to the talk that you gave on business models and also the one that I gave on progressive
32:00
decentralization in and and I think it would what defense ability comes down to
32:07
in crypto is network effects and switching costs and so where there are strong Network effects whether you know
32:13
around liquidity for example or security there are there are switching costs and
32:20
those switching costs allow for networks to extract some margin of defense ability now maybe less than the margin
32:27
that traditional startups are able to take because their code is proprietary and crypto code is open source but it's
32:33
nonzero now so that's to say that defense ability is important when
32:39
considering fundraising and it'll be important to investors to assess the project on the merits of how defensible
32:45
it is but defensibility does exist and crypto networks and so to the extent
32:51
that you've thought about it and designed for it you know it should be possible to communicate that to
32:57
investors and raise funding accordingly yeah absolutely and I think it's important to know what exactly we mean
Protection
33:04
here by for protection is you could interpret that in two ways you could you could imagine the potential protection
33:09
means making your code base proprietary or something like that and then that would have
33:15
that kind of be the negative result of that would be that you would have a smaller community because people are
33:21
less likely to believe in a platform that's not really open it's not inclusive whereas what you're talking
33:27
about now is for protection that comes from network effects and from the switching costs that emerge as a result
33:32
that's kind of the kind of protection that you would want to go and I think that kind of the fundraising question
33:38
hinges on on whether or network has a potential to be massive and to include a
33:44
very large community so has to become a fundamental kind of primitive that people build on top of each other they
33:50
agreed so the next questions from abhishek i'm hoping i pronouncing that
33:56
correctly do you see room or have a structure for multiple classes of tokens for the
34:02
investors founders and community that distinguish their role in keeping the community and network alive yeah it's a
34:10
good question so they're in traditional startups there are different classes of equity there's common stock and there's
34:17
preferred stock and they have different rights in crypto I don't think I've seen
34:23
a network that has that distinction it's usually the case that most tokens are
34:29
equal but that's not to say that that it's not possible to do otherwise right
34:35
you could imagine assigning certain logic to certain subsets of tokens and
34:41
like for example just sort of thinking out loud through a process of delegation
34:47
you could imagine that you know community votes to to say hey this
34:53
address and their tokens count for double in a voting scheme for example so
34:59
I think you could you can program any kind of classifications that that you want and that's something interesting to
35:06
experiment with but I haven't seen much of that most most tokens amount in the
35:12
network's I've looked at or sort of you know the same or fungible and there's advantages to that of course there's non
35:18
fungible tokens for unique you know digital items and that's a whole another
35:24
thing but yeah I think I think it's a it's an interesting idea to explore
35:29
networks with difference with hierarchy and structure that that you can get in
35:34
equity but here in crypto you'd program it as code maybe a good example might be
Compound
35:41
maybe compound where you have C tokens there's a specific C token for every
35:46
trading pair for every every asset you might kind of lend out to the platform
35:52
and then there's a separate governance token for the whole platform and so those two are kind of very different and
35:58
that one is kind of global for the whole network and then the C tokens are specific to their liquidity providers
36:04
for each of the specific assets yeah maybe that's an example but I think I think you're right that it's probably
36:09
under explored and there's so lot that can be done and it's kind of the sky's the limit given that it's all fully
36:15
programmable oh right yeah the compound example is a good one also maker has died and it has MKR
36:22
so yeah these are not different classes of stock or tokens but they're two
36:28
distinct tokens that sort of are the product of the same network right so
Raising human capital
36:34
there's one more question and this one is from Tina and it reads raising human
36:39
capital versus raising monetary capital is it possible to design a continuous
36:44
flash organization for quote unquote side gigs that first raises human
36:49
capital via Mutual's model and only later raises monetary capital from funds to scale after providing after proving
36:56
product market fit hmm okay so the way I'm interpreting this question is is
37:03
like there's human capital which I which I would sort of classify as a subset of
37:08
production capital and and and there's the financial capital which is just
37:15
money that maybe buys that human capital I think I think this goes back to what I
37:21
was saying earlier where encrypted networks part of the production capital of the network comes not now not just by
37:29
hiring employees to a company but from the community actually contributing resources themselves so that could be that could be in the
37:36
form of human capital could be for example you know community building or you know marketing or you know or code
37:44
right that's all the product of human work and so that's that's part of the
37:51
production capital that community members contribute to crypto networks and so so yeah I think I think it's very
37:58
much the case that human capital has a role to play in in crypto networks and
38:03
it's part of the production capital that they're comprised of yeah absolutely
38:08
well that's one last question okay sweet all right what well thank you guys

How To Evaluate Tokenomics Properly! 🔍
(source: https://youtu.be/-R7mrpayYNc?si=S42BQ5qDwBzlNcBb)


Intro
0:00
ever wondered why some of the coins that
0:02
you hold do worse than others
0:04
well one reason that is often overlooked
0:07
is tokenomics and this honestly could
0:09
make or break a project's performance
0:11
even if they have an amazing team
0:13
groundbreaking technology and everything
0:16
else that you can ask for in this video
0:18
i'm going to explain why tokenomics are
0:20
oh so important i'll give you specifics
0:22
of what you should look for and end with
0:24
a discussion of what does it mean to
0:26
have good tokenomics anyways so if you
0:29
want to be a more savvy investor then
0:31
this video is for you strap in my friend
0:32
and let's roll the intro
0:34
[Music]
Tokenomics and why it matters
0:39
first what do i mean by tokenomics
0:41
anyways well it's literally short for
0:44
token plus economics so it's the
0:46
economics of a token coin you can think
0:48
of each crypto project as having its own
0:51
economy surrounding its token but unlike
0:53
our regular economy where the rules are
0:56
set by the government and central
0:58
bankers crypto economies are completely
1:00
controlled by code this means things
1:02
like what the token is used for what the
1:05
inflation rate is who receives tokens as
1:08
rewards are all defined by the
1:10
underlying protocol these crypto
1:12
projects are essentially creating their
1:13
own micro economies with the goal of
1:16
becoming self-sustaining that's why it's
1:18
so important to define the tokenomics
1:21
properly or else you may find yourself
1:23
in a scenario where the token price goes
1:25
haywire
1:26
rendering the project unusable or
1:28
another scenario where it's so
1:30
unappealing for new users slash
1:32
investors to enter that the project has
1:34
nowhere else to go but the graveyard you
1:36
see that's why i say that it's make or
1:38
break for every crypto project to get
1:40
their tokenomics rights but enough with
1:42
the high level stuff let's dig into some
1:44
specific metrics that you can evaluate
1:47
for each project starting with market
Metric 1 - Market Cap
1:49
cap this is a simple one you just take a
1:52
token's price times its circulating
1:54
supply to get its market capitalization
1:56
but this is a much better way to compare
1:58
tokens instead of focusing on the raw
2:00
price for example lisk and cardano are
2:03
both around two dollars per coin but if
2:06
you take into consideration supply
2:08
lisk has around a 300 million dollar
2:10
market cap whereas cardano has 65
2:13
billion dollar market cap you see the
2:15
huge difference that's why market cap is
2:17
the better indicator of a token's
2:19
economic valuation and keep in mind that
2:21
a market cap also gives us a sense for
2:23
how easy it is to manipulate a token's
2:26
price in either direction aka the lower
2:29
the market cap the easier it is to
2:31
manipulate by the way another related
2:33
metric here is fully diluted market cap
2:35
this is just using the maximum supply of
2:37
a token instead of the currently
2:39
circulating supply to do the calculation
2:42
because remember some projects have
2:43
tokens locked up for later distribution
2:46
here's the thing some people are turned
2:48
off when they look at a project's fully
2:50
diluted market cap and they see some
2:52
ginormous number like even larger than
2:54
ethereum's market cap but personally i
2:56
wouldn't pay too much attention to that
2:58
because a that just means that a small
3:00
percentage of their tokens are currently
3:02
available and b it doesn't tell you
3:04
anything about the release schedule or
3:07
if there's any deflationary pressure etc
3:09
all of those matter and can affect
3:11
future valuation though so it doesn't
3:13
make sense to just assume that the price
3:16
and all those other factors will remain
3:17
the same as more tokens are released
3:20
into circulation which is what this
3:22
metric is doing essentially all right
Metric 2 - Max Supply
3:24
next up is max supply which we've
3:26
already kind of touched on but basically
3:28
some tokens do not have its full supply
3:30
available at launch they lock up some
3:33
for vesting purposes so that early
3:35
investors can't dump all at once or
3:37
maybe they keep some for staking rewards
3:39
that is released over a long period of
3:41
time basically this metric gives you an
3:43
idea of how many more tokens need to be
3:46
absorbed by the market in the future
3:48
keep in mind that some projects don't
3:50
have a cap on future inflation so in
3:52
that case they do not have a max supply
3:54
and that leads us perfectly to our next
Metric 3 - Monetary Policy
3:56
part which is monetary policy basically
3:59
this has to do with the inflation or
4:01
deflation of the token supply aka how
4:04
fast are tokens released in the future
4:06
and how does that rate change over time
4:08
are there any deflationary pressures
4:10
like burning of the fees and how do all
4:13
those things come together to affect the
4:15
overall supply there's a lot to evaluate
4:17
here but keep in mind that there's not
4:19
one right monetary policy like inflation
4:22
is not always a bad thing it could
4:24
really help incentivize stakers that
4:26
keep the network decentralized and
4:28
secure and having a freak ton of
4:30
deflation doesn't guarantee price
4:32
performance either i mean just look at
4:34
safe moon so my whole point here is that
4:36
monetary policy is like a glove it needs
4:38
to fit a project's goals and not be
4:41
arbitrarily set just because some other
4:43
project did it that way okay now on to
4:46
the fun stuff three metrics related to
4:48
each token sale but first a quick shout
B-cube AI trading bots
4:50
out to our sponsors for this video be
4:52
cube they have a marketplace full of ai
4:54
driven crypto trading bots that could
4:56
help you increase the likelihood of
4:58
profits while minimizing risks they
5:00
connect to the top exchanges such as
5:02
binance kucoin and ftx and is completely
5:05
non-custodial too so you never have to
5:08
send your crypto to them they currently
5:10
have 16 trading bots live that you can
5:12
check out right now on their site and
5:14
all of their historical trades are
5:16
listed as well they actually have an
5:18
erc20 token called b-cube that you can
5:20
get on uniswap it has a lot of utilities
5:23
but a huge one is that you can get
5:25
access to their bots for free by staking
5:27
enough of these tokens i'll leave you a
5:28
link down below if you'd like to check
5:30
out more all right next metric is the
Metric 4 - Token Distribution
5:32
token distribution aka how are the
5:35
tokens split up and what is each chunk
5:37
for you can imagine each token supply
5:40
being represented by a pie chart such as
5:42
this one made by masari and then
5:44
different sections represent tokens for
5:46
the team for stakers for the community
5:48
whatever really it's especially
5:50
important to know how the tokens were
5:52
split up at launch and this is called
5:54
the initial token distribution because
5:56
if a small number of insiders hold a lot
5:58
of the tokens then its price is at much
6:01
higher risk of manipulation like sudden
6:03
dumps or unnatural pumps ideally every
6:06
project would be a completely fair
6:08
launch which just means that everyone
6:10
gets a chance to buy tokens from the
6:12
get-go because in that case the tokens
6:14
are distributed more widely from the
6:16
beginning but alas that's not always
6:18
realistic so if there is a pre mine you
6:21
should take a closer look at some other
6:23
details such as my next metric private
Metric 5 - Private Sale Prices
6:25
sale prices most crypto projects that
6:28
raise money through token sales don't
6:30
just have one single round that's the
6:32
same price for everybody instead they
6:34
often do multiple rounds with different
6:36
rules in terms of allocation price and
6:38
who can participate the earliest rounds
6:41
are generally reserved for private
6:42
investors like vcs and they of course
6:45
get in at the lowest price per token
6:47
that's why it's so important to find out
6:49
these details so that you can know what
6:51
price these private investors got in at
6:54
and how many tokens they received in
6:56
return you can use this info to gauge
6:58
their willingness to sell at any given
7:00
price level by calculating how much they
7:02
are in profit for example let's say that
7:05
we're in the middle of a deep bear
7:06
market and all of our bags are in the
7:08
negative but private investors may still
7:11
be in massive profit because they got in
7:13
at such low prices this means that the
7:15
selling pressure for that particular
7:17
project may not be over anytime soon
7:20
until most of them end up selling in
7:22
order to lock in their profits and one
7:24
key consideration that's related to this
7:26
is my next metric the unlock schedule
Metric 6 - Unlock Schedule
7:29
basically some projects lock up some of
7:31
their tokens and then release them over
7:33
time the unlocked schedule specifies
7:36
what percentage is released to who and
7:38
at what intervals one example of this is
7:41
vesting schedule for early investors
7:43
instead of letting them get 100 percent
7:45
of the tokens immediately after launch
7:47
they may get 25 in year one 25 percent
7:50
of year two and so forth until they
7:52
receive their entire balance it's super
7:54
important to know the schedule though so
7:56
you can know when to expect a large
7:58
increase in the circulating supply
8:00
because that may cause the price to dump
8:02
or at least serve as some resistance
Metric 7 - Token Utility (6 types)
8:05
last but not least you cannot evaluate a
8:07
project's tokenomics without
8:09
understanding its token utility as well
8:11
and here are six common themes i've seen
8:13
tokens being used for first is for
8:15
payments basically the coiner token aims
8:18
to be a currency that can be used to pay
8:20
for goods and services like bitcoin or
8:23
litecoin are great examples of this
8:25
second is for transaction fees this is
8:27
where you are charged some tokens in
8:29
order to perform transactions on the
8:31
network ethereum is a great example of
8:33
this third is for access to network
8:35
services like for filecoin you can pay
8:38
in their tokens in order to store and
8:40
retrieve data fourth is for discounts or
8:42
cash back we usually see this with
8:44
exchanges where if you hold or use their
8:46
token you get a discount of the trading
8:49
fees or earn cashback in their tokens
8:52
binance gives you fee discounts for
8:54
holding bnb and crypto.com's debit cards
8:57
give you cashback rewards and their cro
8:59
token fifth is for staking for proof of
9:01
stake blockchains you can use their
9:03
tokens for staking and be a validator
9:05
this helps increase the network security
9:08
and decentralization and the best part
9:10
is stakers and validators are usually
9:12
rewarded in the form of more tokens and
9:14
last but not least sixth is for
9:16
governance these are for projects where
9:18
token holders collectively manage and
9:20
change the protocol by voting on various
9:22
proposals you see this often with d5
9:25
projects where token holders control the
9:26
interest rates or decide which assets to
9:29
add or remove generally speaking the
9:31
more tokens you hold the more weight
9:33
your vote gets alright so i gotta admit
Final Pro Tips
9:36
that was a lot to digest but hopefully
9:38
you have a better idea of what to look
9:40
for when you go evaluate at projects to
9:42
economics let's take a step back and
9:44
talk overall strategy though because i
9:46
have some tips for you that may seem
9:48
counterintuitive first is that no
9:50
project is going to be perfect on all of
9:52
these categories so it's ultimately up
9:54
to you to evaluate them holistically and
9:56
make a judgment call and second is that
9:58
while tokenomics are super important it
10:00
doesn't guarantee a project's success
10:02
either there are a lot of other factors
10:04
that come into play i mean heck i've
10:06
even seen some projects with terrible
10:08
tokenomics do well because they get
10:10
saved by other factors like dogecoin
10:13
terrible tokenomics but superb community
10:16
and meme power in an ideal world tokens
10:18
offer true utility within their
10:20
ecosystem and people are incentivized to
10:23
hold or use the token for reasons beyond
10:26
speculation when you go do your research
10:28
on a project's tokenomics you can use
10:30
websites like coin market cap ether scan
10:33
ico drops and masari to find the info
10:35
you need if some piece of info is not
10:38
available then go ask the team and if
10:40
they refuse to share it then that's a
10:42
huge red flag personally i would vote
10:44
with my money and not invest in them but
10:46
anyways i hope this all makes sense and
10:48
you learned something new that you can
10:50
use today if you have any questions or
10:52
comments definitely leave them down
10:53
below and be sure to watch this video if
10:56
you want to stay safe in the crypto
10:58
world and never get hacked i highly
11:00
recommend everyone who's a crypto
11:01
investor to give that a watch anyways
11:03
i'm kevin from coincider i can't wait to
11:05
see in the next one and cheers



EP 11: Token Economist Explains How To Design Digital Economies with Tokens (Tokenomics)
(source: https://youtu.be/cLYDWPuOi_k?si=hYVgrERB5WnL9TvC)



Intro
0:00
In an ideal world there will be one model that  serves all the different ecosystem purposes   unfortunately we don't live in the ideal world and  there is no one model that fits all the different  
0:08
digital ecosystems or crypto ecosystems so when  it comes to token there isn't one ideal token  
0:14
economics model or tokenomics model that could  fit into all your different ecosystem systems that   being said though there are frameworks available  that we'll talk about the different variables and  
0:24
different perspectives and different aspects and  principles to apply into building your ecosystem  
0:30
into buidling your principles of your ecosystem  in the past 10 weeks we've covered quite a bit  
0:36
of different case studies different crypto and  non crypto examples as well as some economic  
0:41
principles so that you can get a rough idea of  what it means when we're talking about economics  
0:46
design it's more than just having one model  that fits into your ecosystem it's not just   about designing the tokens of your ecosystem it's  a lot more than that it's about resolution about  
0:55
governmence about your monetary policy about your  network effects about your network design about  
1:00
your incentive models there's so many aspects into  that so in this episode we're going to deep dive  
1:05
into what I've been researching for two years  which is the framework the complete framework  
1:10
of how you can start building your token ecosystem  today we're gonna cover three things one what is   the token economics framework two what are the  different aspects the elements to consider and  
1:20
three is how can we use them so buckle your  seatbelt and let's get started one what is  
Tokenomics
1:31
the tokenomics model when we talk about token  economics it's not just simply about applying   the economics that's available out there and  then applying into your digital system the thing  
1:40
is economics has changed just like how viruses  evolve just like how humans have been evolving   how just like how DNA has evolved economics has  also evolved we started all the way in the old  
1:50
economics where it's an accounting system it's  a physical ledger of different aspects different  
1:56
resources of goods being created reproduced and  there's a cost in production and you have all your  
2:03
production costs your marginal cost and all that  kind of stuff if I want to produce one more phone   one more iPhone there's a cost to produce one more  iPhone if I take a snapshot of the iPhone and I  
2:13
send it to you it's free because I'll do is just  copy and paste when there is a cost of producing   one more iPhone that it's called a marginal cost  so the cost of producing one additional iPhone and  
2:23
the cost is more than zero because you have your  different raw materials for the iPhone but for   an image that's it you know you take a picture  you just send it to everyone you share it on  
2:32
Twitter but you go download it people reupload  it and it's free it's just available out there   so there's no cost to that and so the marginal  cost is zero because of that the whole dynamics  
2:43
the whole understanding of supply demand the whole  idea of costing changes quite a bit because we are  
2:48
no longer looking at our economy our physical  economy our real world economy as just a simple  
2:55
mathematics as okay the cost of batteries the  cost of glass the cost of the metals and the  
3:01
cost of copper and all the other materials needed  to build the iPhone all we have to do now is just  
3:06
copy and paste so the cost structure has changed  because of that whole idea of economics our whole  
3:12
idea how we calculate economics has also changed  it's not a drastic change but it has to keep  
3:18
continuously evolve in digital goods the costs the  fixed costs you know the initial cost to produce  
3:24
something it's a lot more than that other kind of  costs involved so this is one of the big changing   factors the other thing is also there because  previously we had money we had these kind of  
3:34
costs it's quite obvious to organize all these  coordinate or transactions within our ecosystem  
3:39
today because the cost structure has changed  so how are you going to coordinate all these   transactions in place in in a very private group  so for example private blockchain like your Corda  
3:49
or have a Hyperledger Fabric they are governed  by a private blockchain which means that you  
3:56
need to be a proof to enter and because you need  to be approved to enter you have to abide by the   rules because if you don't abide by the rules  you are kicked out of the group that allows some  
4:05
form of coordination but in public blockchains  you know we have all these dapps going on all   these decentralized finance application you have  Ethereum you have Bitcoin and nobody owns them  
4:15
at all so in these kind of ecosystems how do we  coordinate we have rules but people don't have to  
4:21
100% abide by the rules because they cannot  exactly kicked out so how do we coordinate   that how do we coordinate transactions between  different participants so this is where we have a  
4:31
token coming in a token doesn't necessarily means  monetary value a token just representing value it  
4:38
doesn't have to be monetary value it can just be  any value at that the ecosystem produces that can   be used to be transferred within your ecosystem  the easiest way is monetary value and and that’s  
4:49
why one of thes first use cases is always crypto  currencies instead of crypto product or crypto  
4:56
tokens digital tokens don't necessarily mean  cryptocurrencies they could have different kind   of functions but cryptocurrencies itself is one of  the biggest use cases because it's the easiest to  
5:05
measure its value in terms of monetary value hence  currency that being said there are a lot of other  
5:11
functions available like a utility function  a security function stable coin like a pegged  
5:16
function and therefore a lot of other functions  are emerging as the ecosystem continues to grow so  
5:22
these functions are not standard or are not fixed  they can have different types of functions and you  
5:27
can have two functions in one token of which one  of them would be a more dominant primary function  
5:32
the example BNB token that we talked about last  week where there has a fundamental function of  
5:38
a utility token and then your secondary function  performs as a form of currency so Co tokens can  
5:45
have different kind of functions tokens can have  different types of utility as well and that's  
5:52
not fixed what it just represents is to represent  value that can be used and that can be transacted  
6:00
within your ecosystem as a form of coordination  now let's get started with the more nitty-gritty   stuff which I think it's super interesting what  I've been doing for the past two years is to  
6:09
really deconstruct economics into its principles  so I personally believe that principles don't  
6:15
change everything else changes but principles  don't change oh they take a very long time to   change so they don't really evolve because of that  we can always apply principles and adapt them to  
6:25
different situations so in economics you don't  have laws in physics you can argue that there  
6:31
are laws available I know a lot of my physics  friends will not agree with that to me gravity is  
6:36
law you can go anywhere in the world you can weigh  whatever weight you are you can be a feather you   can be a rock gravity will still act on you it's a  law it's a fundamental law that cannot be changed  
6:45
and cannot be altered and you can't argue against  that gravity is gravity right in physics you have  
6:50
these kind of laws I'm just comparing physics  hard science with economics soft science soft  
6:56
science you don't really have laws in place which  is why soft sciences are so much more difficult   like economics in economics we don't have laws  per se but we have principles principles that  
7:06
there are more or less quite congruent with time  sure you have different school of thoughts in  
7:12
the macroeconomics perspective but the principles  don't change if we talk about economic principles  
7:17
in two episodes before on supply and demand and  behavioral economics so these are two principles  
7:24
that so far are more or less pretty standard you  have some exceptions here and there but these are  
7:29
still quite fundamental principles of economics  so what I've been doing for the past two years was  
7:34
to take all these economics concepts you have  your agent principal model you have your game   theory asymmetric information your information  theory monetary policies all these different  
7:44
economic fields and school thoughts coming  together break them down deconstruct them  
7:49
into principles applying these principles to build  a framework for economics why do I want to do that  
7:56
why don't I just use economic principles that are  already out in place the answer is simple that I   just said because economics has evolved over time  we're no longer in just a physical world we are  
8:05
also moving into a physical and digital world and  with this Coronavirus you see that everything is  
8:10
moving more digital and with that the economics  of these digital ecosystem have changed because  
Token Economics Framework
8:16
the economics keep changing we have to also update  the economic frameworks with time and frameworks  
8:22
with what the changing society is demanding hence  this economics framework this economics framework  
8:29
is divided into three pillars you have market  design mechanism design and token design market  
8:35
design was talked about a few episodes ago to give  you an idea of what it is but I think it's better  
8:41
to give you a full picture first of what token a  token framework is then it make everything will   start falling to pieces a lot easier so this token  economics framework is really focusing on creating  
8:52
or designing the economics where you have tokens  as your incentive model if you don't have tokens  
8:58
as for incentive model it's also fine you just  remove one of the pillars so what are the three   pillars then if I mentioned its market design  first and market design is the design in which  
9:08
your tokens involve in not just tokens but your  participants interact with so if you're talking  
9:15
about your we have different kind of fishes what  the market design is how do you design your pond  
9:22
or your aquarium for these fishes to be swimming  around it to interact with each other so instead  
9:27
of fishes we have tokens and participants how  do we how we creating this environment to allow  
9:33
them to interact with each other right to be safe  for them to interact to trade to continue using  
9:38
the environment the second is mechanism design  mechanism design is also what we call the rules  
9:45
of the game it's the opposite of game theory so  game theory is where you have different strategies  
9:51
and then you find out what the outcome is it’s  like in chess your knight moves this way and your  
9:57
king moves this way and based on all the different  movements you can decide what the outcome would be  
10:02
that would be game theory you know an analysis of  decision-making mechanism design is the opposite  
10:08
mechanism design this is the objective that I want  this is the outcome that I want what kind of rules   can I put in place so if I get to change the  knight piece and the king pieces on chess moves  
10:24
if there's a specific outcome that I want how can  I design the new movements or the new strategies  
10:32
of knight new movement of knight pieces and king  pieces so that I can get the outcome that I want  
10:38
so that is mechanism design how do you design  the mechanism to reach the objectives that you   want so once again so that it's not confusing game  theory is to analyze the outcome mechanism design  
10:50
is based on the outcome I want to create the rules  in place that's it so we know the outcome that we  
10:56
want the outcome is basically the objectives of  designing this ecosystem economic design is all  
11:01
about having an objective in mind and then you  design the incentives and mechanism to achieve   their objective or to achieve the end result  the decision again so what kind of mechanisms  
11:11
can we put in place so that's pillar two mechanism  design and the pillar three is token design token  
11:17
design is optional as I mentioned because some  ecosystem just don't require tokens for example  
11:22
in private blockchains some of them just don't  require tokens so it's okay you don't have to   care about tokens but what tokens essentially  are is that tokens are the incentive mechanism  
11:32
or tokens is the incentive itself to allow for  coordination within your ecosystem because your  
11:39
ecosystem can be too big too great and if too  many individuals coming into your ecosystem that  
11:45
governance alone you know proper rules in place  are not enough to deter people from misbehaving  
11:50
so you have incentives which are your tokens is up  to incentivize people to behave and act according  
11:56
to what you want I know it sounds very you know  mastermind puppet but no it's just design if you  
12:02
look at other types of design like a marketing  design or graphical design these are things that  
12:07
they also consider what are the outcomes that you  want and how do you design something towards the  
12:14
outcome that you want we're just doing it in a  different form instead of marketing or instead   of drawing graphic and instead of printing a very  beautiful or writing a very beautiful copy what  
12:23
we're doing is designing the economics or the  mechanism or the more technical nitty-gritty  
12:29
behind the scene kind of stuff and that's why it's  very interesting so let's look a little bit more  
12:36
at what the different pillars are I've designed  the framework into a very nice little table and  
Pillar Structure
12:47
there are nine boxes in each so in each pillar so  you make a market design mechanism design token  
12:53
design in each pillar you have three boxes and  each box you have other variables involved I think  
13:00
it's very important to go broad to very narrow so  the broad one would be the design the different  
13:06
pillars itself you have to design the environment  you have to design the rules then you have to   design the incentive itself those are the three  pillars then within each pillar you have more like  
13:15
broader subcategories of each different pillar to  consider and within each category then you have  
13:21
more variable sub variables that continuously  expand as the ecosystem involves grows and new  
13:27
types of ecosystem emerges I think that's a neater  way to get started because the thing is there is  
13:33
no one size fits all mechanism or one size fits  all model but there are frameworks available like  
13:39
this framework for instance right you can pick and  choose the kind of variables there is suitable for   you and for your ecosystem and you could pick  them to design them also the thing is this is  
13:50
not exclusive right there are a lot more variables  or a lot more categories that will continuously  
13:56
evolve so this frame will continuously be updated  as the ecosystem grows as more research and  
14:02
literature as available that being said it's still  good enough to use and get started another thing  
14:09
is that all these variables are things that can be  designed can be designed within your control as a  
14:14
designer within your control as an economist to  design them there are a lot of other factors and  
14:19
variables out there that you just can't control  like people's reaction to things how speculative  
14:24
the market is secondary market and a lot of other  things that you simply just can't control although  
14:30
you can have them you can follow this to the  tee and design the most beautiful design ever  
14:36
also bear in mind that there are things that's not  within your control because you can't control them   they can be quite important factors they could  affect your success of your ecosystem itself let's  
14:45
get started with market design market design has  three factors thing thickness no congestion and   safety thickness is where you have enough people  involved or enough participants so that there  
Market Design
14:58
are options available and they can transact with  each other if there's too many participants they   can be quite overwhelmed and that's where you have  congestion on decision-making which is the second  
15:07
point or you have too little then there isn't  enough options and people to trade and that's   where you have a problem so thickness is very  important the second thing is no congestion like  
15:16
I mentioned if there are too many people out  there too many transactions taking place then   the network can be very congested the network can  have too many transactions going on and it's just  
15:24
caught up especially the thing about blockchain  and distributed ledger technology is that  
15:31
everything in distributed it might also take a bit  more processing power to match people to reduce  
15:38
congestion and then it could increase the fees  or it could make things very difficult for people   to transanct and take a longer waiting time and  people will transact outside of your platform once  
15:47
again people transact out of your platform you  lose the value that you can capture within your   platform and that is not good and lastly safety  and security you want people to feel safe to  
15:56
participate in your platform usually this can be  solved by the underlying platform the blockchain  
16:01
technology or blockchain platform so for example  the underlying technology will be EOS Ethereum  
16:07
Bitcoin you know the base layer so for this base  layer most of them are cryptographically secure  
16:15
with very complicated algorithm very complicated  cryptography very difficult to decrypt them and  
16:20
different types of you know even quantum resistant  kind of encryption which is good so that layer is  
16:25
you don't have to worry so much the other thing  would be you know how safe it is it hackable can  
16:30
people steal your funds if you're an exchange do  you have a custodial maybe or the people own their  
16:36
own private keys or do you keep the private keys  on their behalf and you could get hacked these are   things to consider let's move on to the second  pillar mechanism design mechanism design looks  
Mechanism Design
16:46
at the rules of the game and the mechanism design  you're looking at a few things we're looking at   governance non-financial incentives as well as  structure there are so many different variables  
16:54
right and each variable has different weightages  not all variables are equally important some  
17:00
variables are way more important and I would say  that governance is the most important of all the   variables available but that could also depend  on your type of ecosystem if your ecosystem  
17:10
is centralized there may be governance is not  so important because the central authority or   will be governing it so other variables are more  important it really depends some projects really  
17:19
don't require decentralization so or some projects  are not crypto based and just digital ecosystem  
17:24
like Amazon or Facebook then you can have central  governance and that's okay because that's the  
17:29
business model for decentralized ecosystems  I think the governance is very important in   governance we're talking about two things one is  how decisions are being made and second is how  
17:38
resolutions are done think of it as a real country  you have government then you know you have that  
17:46
council the House the Senate the Parliament they  make decisions so they decide how decisions are  
17:53
made resolution will be your legal courts right  you have your lawyers your judges your Supreme  
17:59
Court so in the same way we take these concepts  into your digital ecosystems because these are  
18:06
very important concepts to have with decision  making you can think of your consensus mechanism  
18:11
so for example how many people needs to vote or  how many percentage of vote must be yes or no for  
18:20
things to be passed and how many times you have to  vote so that's all how decision is being made this   is also very important because when we talk about  decentralization we're not just decentralizing the  
18:29
power but we are decentralizing responsibility  that means as long as you are part of the  
18:35
ecosystem you hold the tokens that can allow you  to participate in governance to participate in  
18:41
decision-making you are empowered as an individual  to understand the decision-making mechanisms  
18:47
involved so that you can be part of governance  or you will be part of governmennce because this   is your ecosystem the thing about resolution  mechanism is that part of it can be in code  
18:56
so in mechanism design part of it can be in codes  plus human interaction part of it it's more human  
19:04
interaction resolution mechanism is where you can  have have a bit more code involved as part of the  
19:09
governance the different resolutions available  so to prevent hacks or scams you have your KYC  
19:15
AML to filter people for example you can’t send to  an address that it's not verified so for example  
19:21
it could be a scam and all these things can be  in place without much human interaction it can  
19:27
be in code then you have human interactions where  when something really happens when decision it's a  
19:33
tie so you own the decision side you can’t make  a decision you go to the resolution side where   you have probably bodies of authorities that is  intelligent enough or has enough experience to  
19:42
make the right decision and people can vote on  their decision or not the second variable will  
19:48
be the non-financial incentives why non-financial  incentives and not just incentives because in the   token design itself we have financial incentives  tokens are the incentive itself and they usually  
19:58
have a financial angle because we're talking about  value and one of the easiest way people understand   value is monetary value hence financial incentives  whereas for mechanism design we are just looking  
20:07
at a more basic understanding of non-financial  incentives and here we have two types once again  
20:14
the one that requires more human involvement which  is your voting protocol and the other one requires   more code which is the allocation mechanism so  voting protocol is it really depends and it's I  
20:25
think it's another big area of research that is  super fascinating and interesting so how your  
20:31
voting mechanism is like is it one person one  vote can you outsource that vote to someone how   do you prevent bribery or bribery of vote how do  you reduce voting apathy where people don't vote  
20:41
how do you encourage people to vote how do you  or do you have quadratic voting or do you have   a diminishing vote there are different kind of  voting mechanisms involved and there is no one  
20:51
voting mechanism that’s the best for everything  sure one person one vote is the democratic way   of voting and even Socrates don't really like that  because there are a lot of problems with that you  
21:00
have information asymmetry you have some people  having more knowledge and experience they should   have better voting power because they're more  educated compared to someone who doesn't give a  
21:08
shit about anything and they have the same power  as a person who is educated and experienced in   the matter this is quite unfair I guess that's  what democracy is it's equality to everyone so  
21:17
it depends on your ecosystem if you want full  democracy one person one vote or if you want   one user address one vote or one token one vote  at the same time it's also not fair because some  
21:27
people with very small holdings you know maybe  they're just speculators or maybe there are bad   actors bad actors who just have a 100 votes they  have a they have a 100 tokens and because of that  
21:38
you have 100 votes versus someone who is a  whale who has a lot of tokens so he has more   at stake so maybe he should be also given more  tokens because he will vote correctly so there  
21:47
are a lot of arguments and a lot of debates  for voting it's a very interesting topic on   its own and then we have allocation mechanism  allocation mechanism is I think it's super fun  
21:55
because it's something that can be coded like  Bitcoin where they have allocation mechanism  
22:00
every ten minutes a block is being mined and it’s  allocated to be miner that has the fastest mining  
22:06
speed and then a miner will sell it and whatever  will be allocated in the secondary market but the   primary market is allocated by machines then you  have different types of allocation where you know  
22:16
every maybe every day or every quarter you have  new tokens being minted and then how you're going  
22:22
to distribute to the different people that's also  that's fun that's interesting that's where if your   ecosystem continues to increase in supply that's  how it works if your ecosystem is you have an ICO  
22:32
you distribute all your tokens and that's it you  don't have any new supply of tokens then too bad   that's a different model and you don't have to you  probably don't think so much about allocation then  
22:44
you also have other mechanisms such as ecosystem  recycling their tokens so they purchase the tokens  
22:50
or they collect tokens instead of burning it or  staking it somewhere they reintroduce it back to   the ecosystem and it's distributed accordingly so  that's where allocation mechanism needs to come  
23:00
into consideration and you don't have to do you  don't need much human input for that things can   be run by a machine and the last box in mechanism  design is structure in structure we're looking two  
23:10
things again one that has more human touch and  one with less human touch more machine so the  
23:16
more human one will be bargaining protocol and the  more machine is ommunity information bargaining  
23:23
protocol is how prices are being made they can  be auction first-price english auction dutch  
23:29
auction second-price auction all your different  auction mechanism it could be where sellers set  
23:36
the price or it could be where buyers set the  price and the other one which requires more  
23:43
machine input will be community information that  will be more oracles where the system goes out of  
23:51
chain to get information comes back and verify  with the information on chain so that could be  
23:57
your different oracles that a lot of the Defi  decentralized finance product or dapps use or it  
24:03
could be betting mechanisms like other where the  oracles will go out and get information community   can also put information in other than the machine  going out to get information that it will verify  
24:12
information against each other and lastly we  have token design token design is the design   of the token itself which is the incentive  with incentives we're looking at tokens as  
Token Design
24:22
a representation of value to incentivize people  to interact to transact or to just do something  
24:28
in the ecosystem in token design we're looking  at three things one is token policy in token  
24:33
policy we're taking a lot of aspects from monetary  policy to design your token so this could be stuff  
24:39
like your interest rates if you have interest  rate this could be stuff like a supply schedule   you supply curve when are you introducing new  supply how are you increasing supply and when  
24:49
are you increasing supply so these are different  aspects of monetary policy to consider when you're  
24:54
looking at token I just used the word monetary  policy because it's relevant but this can also   be used for stuff like utility tokens this could  be also used for currency tokens the function is  
25:06
currency the function is utility for valuation  it also depends I'm not talking about valuation  
25:11
as in one perfect model that fits everything  and that’s the golden model the world there’s   no such thing in the world instead I'm looking at  different ways to value your token the valuation  
25:19
depends a lot on what types of tokens they are  what the functions are how it is being used and  
25:25
a lot of other variables to consider there is no  one-size-fits-all valuation but there are alot  
25:31
different models out there to give you an idea  or to give you a proxy of the valuation so for   example you have something that's quite big out  there the P/E ratio to give you an idea of the  
25:40
valuation I don't think there is one absolute  valuation ever I mean at the end of the today   how do we absolutely value one US dollar it's  where people all believe that the valuation is  
25:50
just like that so we also value one US dollar  having it compared to GDP EUR CHF RMB these are  
25:59
ways where we get valuations by comparison and  so valuation also comes in comparing different  
26:06
variables different factors to get its value the  second box in token design is financial incentives  
26:12
in financial incentives we are looking at platform  activities and return to stake platform activities   will be stuff like what are you encouraging or  what are you doing or what are you incentivizing  
26:23
to allow people to do have more activities on  your platform itself this could be referrals this  
26:30
could be different types of incentives needs  to be discounts or tokens the other one will   be returns to stake one mechanism to encourage  people to be keeping your token and holding it  
26:40
is via staking and there are many different ways  to stake many different reasons to stake and one   important reason to incentivize people from a  financial perspective is your returns to stake  
26:49
if you're staking as a validator if you're staking  as part of a Defi network if you're staking as a  
26:55
collateral what are the different opportunity cost  it is to them and what are the different returns  
27:01
that these people can look at and lastly for  the third box we are lookinh at architecture in  
27:06
architecture we're looking at property rights as  well as distribution for property right this might  
27:11
not always be applicable but I think this would  be more applicable to non fungible tokens so the  
27:17
rights that is involved in your tokens so tokens  are incentives and need not just be ERC20 tokens  
27:22
tokens can be non fungible it can be like ERC721  as well these tokens will have different types of  
27:28
property rights and are they going to be embedded  within the token are they going to come with you   know more information attached or are they going  to be transferred to the digital the address owner  
27:39
of the token these are things to consider and  what does it mean to have property rights what   rights does it give to token holders an important  thing to consider is that one of the best things  
27:49
about crypto and once you own something it  is yours it's yours forever okay for instance  
27:55
Cryptokitties Cryptokitties is a computer thing  on blockchain and you have this little kitties  
28:00
if the whole company of Cryptokitties fail the  kitties will still be mine the kitties will not   be shut down and I can still keep these kitties so  that's the rights that I have I own this property  
28:11
no one can take it away from me that's important  to remember in Esports it's really whatever your  
28:17
winnings it's not sure it's you know yours  to keep but if the server if the main server  
28:23
of the company rockfalls I don’t know World of  Warcraft or League of Legend it crashes or the  
28:30
company decides to shut it down you don't have  access to all this so your years of hard work of   playing game is just gone with blockchain you can  always keep it you can always have it will never  
28:40
be shut down so that's the kind of rights that  you have by owning this property sure there are   a lot of other property rights involved maybe you  can own this and when you own this token it gives  
28:49
you access to get of discounts in the future or  it gives you rights to purchase a different type  
28:55
of tokens or only this token allows you to stake  and lastly in token architecture its distribution  
29:00
let's say there is a type of tokens where you have  its linked to all the different addresses before  
29:07
so I have a token and every time a transaction is  being made based on the tokens that I sell it's  
29:13
a non fungible token and every time it's being  sold I would get part of the proportion of the  
29:18
profits so profits are being distributed along  the way ways of distributing incentives in the  
29:25
ecosystem itself so you're always incentive people  to participate to join and to add value to your  
29:32
ecosystem so with that that's your token economics  framework and lastly how use the token economic  
Conclusion
29:43
framework the token economic framework gives  you an idea it gives you a very rough skeleton   for you to start designing and start building  your ecosystem although there's no right answer  
29:52
to designing all these ecosystem there is a good  beginning point for you to get started designing   and once you have the framework involved all  these variables in place all these assets in  
30:00
place it is a lot easier to get started with the  whole mathematical model if you are considering  
30:07
to do one once again very important to consider  one all the variables are not in equal weightage  
30:13
that means some things are more important some  things are less second not every variable is   important these are variables that I found from  a lot of different like a gazillion views in  
30:23
economics that being said not all variables are  important so just choose the one that is important   to your ecosystem and then start designing  third remember that this is only designed in  
30:31
the primary market sure you can do some sort of  financial engineering in your secondary market   to support your design in the primary market but  this is primarily just a primary market what I'm  
30:42
also doing with this framework is to reduce  speculators to continue adding real value   when you have all these variables design and it's  important that you take note of them because they  
30:51
will determine the success of your ecosystem if  you want to have more of these lessons remember   to subscribe to the podcasts we have more  weekly lessons or you want to look at more  
31:01
intense or more intense application sign up  to our class at education.economicsdesign.com  
31:07
and lastly if you have any more things  that you are interested in that you want   to know comment below or reach out to me  and I will take a look at them and do more  
31:15
research and then do an episode on that  till then I'll see the next week bye



Tokenomics Workshop with Luigi Demeo | Avalanche Summit 2022:
(source: https://youtu.be/37Ia0HFTxZo?si=nyA3rW4NIZKBEwUg)



Tokenomics Workshop
0:05
nice to meet you i don't know if i should stand behind you too short
0:12
so uh thank you all for coming my name is luigi um head of d5 ava labs
0:17
been here for about almost a year now and uh really excited to kind of talk to you guys a little bit about tokenomics
0:23
some basic things at a high level so we'll get right into it
Tokenomics - Introduction
0:30
i'm gonna start off just by going through and talking about tokens in general right uh this this term gets
0:35
thrown around a lot but it's really a technical term for for you know anybody who actually has been involved in
0:41
blockchain for a long time but before i get into that i'm going to preface it by saying that this whole presentation is not legal advice
0:47
this is all coming from the perspective of economics so that's a key distinction but when we think about uh tokenomics
0:54
and tokens right they actually they actually mirror a ton of different properties so tokens can
1:01
carry properties of equities and carry properties of things like currencies and commodities and i want to like break
1:07
that up a little bit and and start to explain kind of the differences among them and then how you can start to think
1:13
about how to want to structure your token uh if you want to so equities in general like what do you get
1:19
generally speaking you get ownership in a company you get rights governance rights holding
1:24
rights um you can you know there's also different classes of equities right so
1:30
you kind of split this up in a way to govern something but you also get rights to cash flows or
1:35
what we what we refer to as like benefit streams so you know when you take yourself and
1:40
you know move yourself back it's if i get if i own an equity i own governance in some company and i also
1:47
own rights to cash flows commodities on the other hand a little different all right commodities essentially you have one thing
1:54
that is repeatable so pork bellies for example are commodities and you know if
1:59
i buy one pork belly or another pork belly i still own a pork belly and so they're interchangeable from that perspective so
2:06
commodities are basic good it's fungible and scarce and that's usually where it derives its value from
2:12
and then you have currencies which i think everybody um probably has an understanding of what that is but that's used as like a way to interact in the
2:18
economy and to exchange for other types of goods so when you think about a token as it
2:24
relates to all these things what's the differences what's the similarities well there's pieces of each of these in various tokens and that's what makes
2:30
them unique and that's what makes them almost a new asset class and it's hard to actually characterize them
2:36
sorry okay that works um so bitcoin and eth are
2:41
really the way i want to start this off and explain kind of how we get here so
2:47
you know when you think about bitcoin you think about something that's like cap supply has a very predetermined
2:52
emissions curve uh 21 million bitcoin as everybody knows will only be minted and
2:57
almost 90 percent of that is actually out in in supply at the moment whereas you have something like ethereum right
3:03
was actually pre-mined a lot of it so a little bit of a difference with bitcoin right um
3:08
you know in the sense that it that it had that and also now there's actually a split of fees so that with eip 1559
3:16
some of the fees get burned so that's a new mechanic that was introduced from bitcoin right so these two here
3:22
if you really take a step back and think about it they don't really represent a lot of properties of equities right
3:27
there's not a lot of cash flows being generated directly from the protocol
3:32
you're not necessarily staking a coin to earn revenue from the protocol right if you
3:38
stake ether and proof of stake potentially you could earn each but that's um that's actually a different type of
3:43
process from getting that versus an actual you know app or protocol
3:52
sorry technical issues you go next slide
4:00
cool let me go to the next one we got my wolfy guys up here
4:05
so and taking a look at this like we could start to think through some some actual tokens in applications right um you know
Tokens: Various Structures
4:12
when we think about bitcoin underneath like i said closer to commodities but now we'll start to see some differences
4:17
as we start to think about these apps so you know sushi's you know decent one that i like to explain because
4:24
they came out pretty early um you know generally speaking if you if you stake sushi for x sushi you get a percentage
4:30
of the fees from the protocol it's similar to joe uh trader joe and and you also get
4:35
voting and governance rights so from a economic perspective this very much mirrors an equity
4:42
you know like i own some part of this protocol i can vote on that protocol and i can
4:48
also earn fees from this protocol so pretty much the same thing for uni right except
4:53
don't really get fees from the protocol so a minor distinction there and then platypus up here right that's
4:59
the ptp token very similar as well you get a percentage of fees for the protocol you get voting and governance rights now
5:05
they have new dynamics that they've introduced and we'll explain a little bit later kind of what that actually uh
5:12
changes about the uh the protocol but at a high level these three
5:17
you know you can known as one co you can notice one common denominator that's that they're all d5 right and then we have the tus token
5:23
which is from karbata so this is game 5. um it's a little different now you can only earn tus
5:29
you know via gameplay so you could buy it on dexes but in order to actually earn it you need to actually play the
5:35
game so this is a new dynamic that in d5 is a little bit different um all they burn all their fees as well in
5:42
the marketplace and the taverns right so not only can you only earn this v8 playing the game but a lot of these fees
5:48
are burned um as well and then now this token will also be a gas token in their swimmer network subnet so that's
5:55
something that if anybody hasn't heard yet but subnets in particular allow you to have your own gas token so
6:01
this provides additional utility to tokens and can actually introduce some nice burning mechanisms if that's
6:07
something that a protocol would like so and just taking a look at these four um you know what what's obvious is that
6:15
many d5 tokens represent a lot of the properties of equities and game fight tokens tend to bring
6:22
properties from commodities right because now they start to have this dynamic where you earn them via game
6:28
play and now they also have these dynamics of burning like eth did so it's uh you're
6:35
starting to see a little bit more i would say like experimentation um on the game five stuff so excited to see how
6:41
that kind of develops over time in the next slide
Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
6:46
yeah and then just like kind of using d5 using sushi as an example
6:52
here um you know they originally had infinite inflation and then they've hard capped the token sense from what i
6:57
understand um you know but one thing that i'm going to talk about a little bit that is really interesting in tokens
7:04
and defy um these all are emitted at a certain like time schedule
7:10
which is interesting uh equities are not right think about how equities come into existence
7:15
first the company wants to sell a bunch of stock and for that they get cash and then the only time they sell additional stock is
7:22
when they want to raise more cash so this is a big distinction between tokens and equity tokens are literally
7:27
being emitted by the second so because of this if you were a protocol issuing a
7:33
token and by the way it doesn't have to be that way but it's just for some reason has been
7:38
probably because that's how bitcoin did it first right um so so that's something that's quite interesting to me is like a
7:44
lot of these protocols are emitting tokens number one to incentivize whatever their protocol is incentivizing whether it's
7:50
liquidity in terms of tvl for pools um or for swaps or you know whatever
7:56
they're trying to incentivize in terms of users so um
8:02
if we look at these two charts this is from token terminal which does a nice job of aggregating data on protocols you
8:08
know the first one it kind of gives you an idea of something that i want to dive into a little bit
8:13
on the on the chart on the left you have total revenue that's the bars
8:18
and the price of the actual tokens on the left so quite interesting that those two mirror each other
8:24
very well but if you look on the right tvl versus revenue the yellow line is actual tvl of sushi
8:32
and the right line is revenue what's interesting here is a lot of these protocols are always optimizing for tdl
8:38
however tvl is not really necessarily what accrues to the token holders right um
8:44
if you have 100 million dollars in a pool versus a billion dollars in a pool if
8:49
people only transacting a million dollars worth of that pool you have a lot of inefficient capital in that pool
8:54
which is quite useless so one thing that's really important for me as i as i kind of get through this
9:00
talk is i want to emphasize the fact that protocols dapps need to
9:07
they need to determine first what they are optimizing for so if you're a project and you're building a dex yes you need
9:13
to optimize for tvl but at a certain point you have too much and you're paying too much for that liquidity and
9:19
that's the fine balance of what you need to understand you know uh how do i how do i understand that this pool is sufficing for the
9:26
volume that it's that it's actually transacting on it or not um so this actually does a quite
9:32
nice job of explaining that revenue is quite important to price for this protocol tbl not so much
9:39
um you go to next slide cool so you know i'm kind of getting into
9:45
this now but what's really interesting about this is like like i said so so tvl is not
9:51
necessarily what you want to optimize for fees might be what you want what you want to optimize for and why is that
9:57
right well if the token structure like an equity in terms of the economic characteristics
10:03
fees are the cash flows right to the users so if your protocol is structured like an equity
10:09
but none of the fees are getting sent to the equity holders then you're likely not creating a token that has much value
10:16
right so so that's one thing to to always take take a step back and
10:21
think about what am i optimizing for how am i paying my users um is it via revenue or is it you know a
10:29
game type token token that i'm trying like constantly just trying to admit these are things you need to to kind of
10:35
think through liquidity mining equity mining is an interesting concept uh
10:40
this is something that's very different than equities right we don't mine equities to make people want to buy equities
10:46
right so that's that's a very unique characteristic and what is it really it's a cost to the protocol
10:52
is how i like to think about it so the more you do it and the more you do it to an extent that
10:57
you don't need now you're going to start to to not have profits you're going to start to lose money as a protocol
11:04
so liquidity mining in effect is a way to get people to do something so if you're trying to attract tvl you emit
11:10
tokens such that you get enough tbl but if you continue to do that you're going to start to lose money
11:16
and then voting is the other dynamic right we'll talk a little bit about ve mechanics and governance but
11:23
these are the four major variables as it relates to d5 and um if
11:28
you're optimizing like i said for tvl then you know fees are actually what you should be if
11:35
your token is structured like an equity and um you know when it as it relates to like staking
11:40
ve all these types of dynamics all that's really doing is taking coins out of circulation
11:46
which is fine that's something you do want to do you do want to restrict supply but don't think that that is what's
11:52
actually creating value for the holder that creates you know very little value to the holder to be honest with you
11:57
other than the governance rights that you get so once again it becomes an optimization question
12:03
uh could you go next slide please yep um and then one more
12:10
yeah why should you care about any of this we'll get into that but first i have this little
12:15
very very basic rudimentary kind of way i like to boil it down
12:20
so like i said revenue or your fees if you structure your token like an equity cost
12:25
of goods sold it's basically liquidity mining it's a cost of the protocol you net your profit right now if you
12:31
take your profit of your protocol and divide it by how many coins are in circulation and this work this is where it gets to
12:37
these d5 dynamics right our d5 dynamics are effectively like how do i take less
12:43
tokens that are trading in the market and and and like put them into different things
12:48
how do i make ve dynamics this way there's less tokens trading how do i like make people stake 16 ways to sunday
12:55
this way like there's less tokens these are all the things that protocols are trying to do and they work
13:00
in very intermittent times but they won't work over the long term if you still haven't solved for a yeah
13:06
all right so you need the revenue at the top line and that's like the big thing that i tell all these protocols because like they don't focus on it enough but
13:13
fee generation is the most important thing at the end of the day otherwise the owner of the token is not owning
13:18
anything they're just owning something that like less people have access to in that moment in time but eventually you're
13:25
going to need access to it um and so at the end of the day you get to profit per se per circulating coin and
13:32
this is effectively you're going to be your apy right so if you restrict supply of the coin apy goes up
13:39
that's pretty pretty basic um any questions on the slide
13:47
cool now we can go to the next one cool so what are some things that uh you
13:52
know i've started talking to projects with that i like them to see so dynamic supply schedules be really cool
13:58
to see i don't see a lot of that yet but once again i started to explain the beginning this whole idea of fixed emissions over
14:05
time is something that i think we need to get away from if your token is structured like an equity it really literally makes
14:11
no sense the only the only reason that that exists is because frankly
14:17
it was needed for bitcoin to solve you know not only the mining issue but also the difficulty algorithm that they have
14:23
um to kind of keep those coins in circulation but would be really cool to see
14:30
a protocol that emits tokens when it needs to emit tokens and doesn't emit tokens when it doesn't need to admit
14:35
tokens right let's get a little bit more thoughtful about how we're actually giving tokens out um
14:41
so like i kind of like said that here right equities issue a secondary it's called when the stock is overvalued typically
14:48
and they want to erase cash my stock's trading at 100 right i do a secondary
14:53
and then now i have a bunch of cash and generally speaking people can get more of those in supply
14:59
they do a buyback when they think that you know the stock is cheap right and they buy their own stock with their own
15:04
cash and effectively take stocks out of supply they remove stock
15:10
from the market so this is a little bit more dynamic it happens very manual in in equities but it'd be really cool i
15:16
think in crypto if we could start to do this in a way that's dynamic and algorithmic um i think some algo staple coins have
15:23
methods of this but it's a little bit different so emissions only when you need them are something that i think
15:29
will set the stage for d5 to kind of really grow that's something that i think we
15:34
can get a lot more thoughtful about and then this is kind of another point um sort of alluding to the same thing i
15:41
was mentioning but you know the marginal benefit of another dollar liquidity is something that
15:48
not enough protocols think about i know there's a lot of consultants like gauntlet
15:55
and chaos labs that do analysis like this and that's super helpful but not all not new dapps not all new dapps can
16:01
afford to do this right they can't afford to pay a ton of money for consultants so they need to learn how to how to structure this stuff in the
16:07
beginning so this kind of gets to the same point but you don't need to maximize tvl for one
16:13
pool if you're a dex that nobody's trading in you need to maximize tvl for the pool that people are trading in so
16:20
focus on on fees is like the best way to understand that where are people trading
16:25
how do i get enough liquidity in those pools such that they can trade efficiently with minimal slippage i know
16:31
andre when he did when they did the ve-33 this is something that they harped on a lot like
16:36
this was the new focus was how do we actually focus on a fee generation market rather than a liquidity market
16:42
liquidity at the end of the day is a means to an end it's not what you're trying to achieve the whole time as a protocol
16:48
it's effectively how do i get enough liquidity in order to have my users be able to have low slippage
16:56
and then having liquidity mining uh incentives be a little bit more targeted would actually be a natural benefit for
17:01
this so how do we how do we get to a point where um look like i see this all the time with
17:07
projects who are emitting a ton of tokens to a pool that does not need that you know and you know we actually tell
17:14
them hey look you know you should probably rotate that to this pool because there's not enough liquidity but there's a ton of people using it same
17:19
for dexes i mean same for lending platforms right you know if the utilization rate is really high
17:25
on that landing pool you probably want to incentivize it more so there's actual ways to do this algorithmically
17:32
but um for some reason we haven't gotten there yet gotten there yet on d5 next slide please
Tokenomics Tips for Blockchain Developers
17:40
cool and so now you know this is the kind of the way i wanted to boil it down i just wanted to give some tips
17:46
you know we at abba labs talk to i don't know like 50 50 projects a week
17:52
or something like that so we we get to see a lot of ways that founders are thinking about
17:58
things and you know crypto is very much a copycat
18:03
uh industry in a sense you know uh one person launches a ve project and then there's 45 you know standing outside the
18:10
door but they don't really understand a lot of times why that ve is there and what the point of it is right
18:16
so first one teams and advisors right [Music]
18:23
this is one thing that when i see i get super concerned about if the team advisor tokens aren't really locked past
18:29
the point when like the road map is basically like completely finished at a
18:34
certain point and then i'm like worried you know um if the road map is like five years
18:40
that's also worrisome it shouldn't take five years to build some of this stuff so you know what you want to see is something
18:46
like hey you know we're launching an mvp basic product um you know and then we
18:52
plan to get to the full feature-rich product in six months then you want to see them locked for at least for another
18:57
six months cliff and then years after because you want you want to make sure that they're there to continue to build a protocol a lot of these things start
19:04
out super centralized and decentralized over time but if the team isn't locked to that protocol in the beginning then
19:11
you know that's generally speaking a worrisome situation that they might try to sell
19:17
their tokens right away or you know it could be just some you know scam or something like that
19:23
um dollar bearing yes uh
19:28
this is this is a a common mistake in crypto paying the team in the token um
19:34
you know human beings have dollar obligations or stable obligations
19:39
food you know house all those things and if your token goes from 50 cents to 30
19:44
back to 50 cents we consistently see a situation where you know they feel super rich at the top
19:50
super poor at the bottom and you know uh nowhere in between and then they're like trying to raise around at 50 cents or
19:57
like a 45 percent discount even though their token was just at 20 dollars like you don't want to be doing this
20:02
so once you get like to an established place you need to raise cash to pay your team
20:08
not only that but it also creates bad incentives for the team i've seen plenty of teams that had really strong developers who quit halfway through the
20:15
project because they got super rich on team tokens and this isn't their team allocation this is literally what they
20:20
were getting paid in salary right so if you're getting paid in salary and tokens that go up a thousand
20:25
x you probably don't need to work as hard and the team's less committed so
20:30
this is a common mistake don't do it but also it also creates a lot of cell pressure um so if you're paying out salaries
20:36
every week i've literally seen tokens that sell off at the same time every week like come on guys
20:43
like this we don't need to be doing that so raise cash at the right time to pay out your team that's something that i
20:50
think is pretty self-explanatory but um you know if you worked at apple they're not paying you in apple stock so
20:56
you could feed your family it just doesn't really make sense um and then token unlocks structuring
21:02
this is pretty pretty it sounds simple and like common sense but once again big
21:07
mistake you don't want to be having token unlocks happening at the same time you don't want you don't want to happen
21:13
around times where you know liquidity is going to be low right you want to make sure that token
21:18
unlocks as a percentage of traded volume is quite low you don't want it to impact the market
21:23
number one it raises a ton of flags as to why the team's selling which you know is a legitimate question uh
21:30
same with advisors same with vcs and investors all right so you want to be able to structure out the way that they
21:36
unlock their tokens over time such that they won't be uh you know hurting the market in terms of price
21:43
uh and we talked about this a little bit but liquidity mining were effective a lot of these like i said a lot of these protocols they start out they just
21:50
mine tokens um you know forever and ever but don't actually get anything out of
21:55
it one thing i tell people all the time like you know scarcity is only a real thing if it's
22:00
actually scarce um you know fake scarcity is not real if the protocol can just print more tokens
22:06
if it wants to bitcoin is actually scarce because the odds of getting a governance proposal
22:12
um passed to raise the the cap of bitcoin from 21 million to 42 million is like
22:18
slow you know slim to none but if the governance process is two founders and a multi-sig
22:23
you know they'll probably have no issues emitting more tokens when they want to so you know that's you know i love when the the
22:30
first opening line of a pitch is they'll only be 100 million tokens minted i'm like okay we'll see
22:37
you know because if they if they don't do their liquidity mining math correctly then what happens
22:42
they're going to emit more tokens right because they don't have a way to attract what they need to attract for the protocol
22:47
all right so make sure you want to be thoughtful about your liquidity mining when
22:52
and you know how to make that super effective um
22:58
make sure you have enough allocation to bootstrapping liquidity okay so this is another big mistake
23:03
um let's say you have a dapp called jane
23:09
right and uh your token's name is jane and you want to create a jainavox pool on a dex right you want to you want
23:16
people to create a pool so they can trade your token well you know a lot of times what i see is that there's not enough liquidity in
23:22
that the token the token price goes up and down like crazy and there's no stability
23:27
the real side effect of that is you're actually using your token as an incentive to attracting whatever you're
23:34
trying to attract in your application so if you're building a lending platform you want to track liquidity so if your
23:39
token is super volatile your apys ap apys that you're trying to trying to
23:46
effectively use as the carrot stick are moving up and down right so you're not actually building anything
23:53
sustainable and something that can actually work over time and it's super volatile and people get disenfranchised
23:58
so you want to make sure that you're putting enough liquidity in yourself as a protocol if possible or
24:04
you're going down this path of you know something that's become a little bit more prevalent lately which is called protocol protocol own liquidity
24:10
and that effectively is a way to make sure that your actual dap owns that pool or parts of it so if there's a million
24:17
dollars in the pool and you have 250 k worth as long as you don't pull it out you know that there's always 250k that
24:22
you're market making as the protocol and because of that you've actually created a base if you're doing that that's a
24:28
smart way to start um because now like you know if the ap y's on your on your dex pool go down and
24:35
everybody starts pulling out as you know in terms of being a liquidity provider
24:40
you're really going to be in a tough spot now because now your token's going to get really volatile um and and and
24:47
you know you're going to have to send a bunch of tokens as a farm to to admit to
24:52
you know incentivize more liquidity so you want to be careful about that so either owns own a decent portion of the
24:58
pool in terms of the protocol itself or find a way to actually make it
25:03
very uh advantageous not a lot of people want to be a liquidity provider for
25:09
random token x and a box like it's not super attractive from a from an impermanent loss perspective so you know
25:16
you have to either make it attractive via farming emissions which isn't really sustainable or you need to have some
25:21
protocol liquidity another one liquidity across chains
25:27
another huge mistake um i don't want to beat up on sushi but this was something that like you know i think was it was it
25:33
was a real problem for them there was no deep liquidity on any of the non-eth chains right so
25:40
you were trying to trade the sushi token you weren't able to get any decent size on avalanche on
25:46
phantom on harmony on any other chain and what what you do in that in that situation is you know if there's only so
25:53
many tokens and some of them are split across all the chains you really have no liquidity
25:59
anywhere and when a whale wants to trade in size now they're literally like trying to buy up pieces across all the
26:05
pools and if you haven't managed like a bunch of r bots to actually arbitrage all that liquidity across chains now you
26:11
have a lot of dislocations across the chains it gets super messy so when you want to do
26:16
cross chain tokens there's a few models that are starting to develop that are interesting i mean
26:22
the eth one that that you know i think has done the best job so far is curve all right their token actually
26:29
does work as a cross-chain token across all these different chains right you vote on actually now you can vote on all
26:35
chains um for crv emissions and those crv emissions are actually emitted across all the different chains to the
26:41
pools and you know you also have cross-chain governance across all the chains so
26:47
that's a nice way to kind of do this but it's still not perfect so i think we'll see more of like a franchise model
26:53
going forward which is more like new tokens on different chains um i think you know defy kingdoms is one
26:59
that's doing that um i think that you'll see a little bit more of that as it relates if there's a good use case
27:05
like a token just to have a token it's not really going to create value in the long term
27:12
and then last we're just going to hit home on this point again about optimization you know start start
27:17
thinking about your tokenomics from the beginning about what am i optimizing for right do i want to generate fees for my
27:24
my token holder is it just a token to use in a game to burn for to buy nfts
27:32
you know like at the end of the day what am i actually what do i actually want people to do start from there and then
27:37
you can easily find ways to actually bring value to your token so it becomes a very simple optimization
27:43
problem but if you start from the the very simple principles then i think you'll end up in a good place
27:49
last is innovate you know we haven't seen much innovation in d5 in the last few months it's been really
27:54
disappointing but i think we will as markets change so if you can you know start with
28:00
tokenomics changes that are interesting that's a good way to start like like i mentioned before ve dynamics and all
28:07
these ways to restrict supply are nice but at the end of the day that doesn't create long-term value that just reduces
28:12
the circulating supply of the coin which makes the ones that are circulating more desired
28:19
i think that's it yeah any questions guys
Audience Q&A
28:26
sure
28:50
oh show some projects that's tough um
28:57
i would i would say um i think so far i thought platypus did a nice job of
29:02
their token design uh i think there's still ways for them to improve it um i think just like like i mentioned
29:09
here some of the things i'm suggesting don't exist like dynamic supplies
29:14
that i don't think i've seen it anywhere so i think the first one to figure that out is actually going to create a huge
29:20
advancement for all protocols and i think everybody will start to
29:25
copycat that um but that that that makes most sense when it's structured like an equity or token right um
29:31
so i think they did a nice job i like what trader joe has done in terms of splitting up uh different use cases for
29:37
their token with rocket joe ve joe i think which they launched i haven't gotten to play with you i've been too
29:43
busy here um but and then s joe which is really cool staking joe to earn
29:49
so here's a good example right staking joe to become s joe to earn cash flows in stable coins
29:55
literally is very similar to an equity right um and and so like that i think makes sense
30:01
for for folks any other questions yeah ubt native gas tokens on subnets do we
30:08
think avox will still keep its value although the demand will increase or decrease
30:14
so i think the question is uh if if ibox is not the gas token
30:20
for it if all the main projects will move to subnets have it and start using their own tokens as a gas token
30:26
sure the demand for a box will decrease it seems um no i disagree um so a few
30:33
reasons why number one you need to buy 2 000 a vox and stake it to be a validator and you
30:39
cannot validate a subnet unless you validate the main net so at a minimum you always have people buying the 2000
30:44
box that requirement could go up and down with governance the other reason is i think the c chain will always be the hub and
30:50
for d phi in particular which is super composable you you know it's better to be on one chain and i think that you
30:57
know the amount of of a box that we're burning will likely go up on the c chain but
31:04
don't be surprised to also see a vox be a gas token on subnets there's no reason why i can't
31:10
you have an option as a protocol but a lot of protocols it might not be beneficial for them to burn a token
31:15
that's their own and i already i'm talking to a bunch of subnet
31:21
type of operators who actually want to use vox as their gas token as well so i think the growth of the network
31:26
will naturally grow demand of that token so how do you feel about projects that
31:32
um they have you know a lock-up period for their for their investors right but they release a percentage of that in the
31:39
tge oh i see for the investors um yeah yeah that's a good question um
31:47
if the road map isn't delivered upon yet i think that's probably not a good idea um because effectively what you're doing
31:54
is you're putting a ton of tokens in circulation if they got in a super super private seed round they're up like
32:01
hundreds of x a lot of times and at that point it's very obvious and and i don't shame them for because
32:07
frankly they would be um irresponsible not to sell some at that point because you know they're up a
32:13
bunch on their project they should sell some so you probably want to make to me i would tie it to the road map
32:18
if your roadmap isn't delivered upon yet the team needs to be you know committed to the project but
32:23
you also want your investors committed they're supposed to help you like it doesn't happen a lot but they're supposed to help you you know they're
32:30
supposed to make introductions they're supposed to do all these things right so you want to make sure that they're committed to you as well
32:37
and and that's the way to make them committed any other questions
32:42
yes oh whoever's got the remote oh you have it yeah um so it seems like a lot of
32:48
these tokenomic issues stem from the need for having those amm pools um the pool liquidity do you see limit order
32:55
books as a potential solution and why do you think something like deck slot hasn't taken off in light of that oh
33:00
good question um a few things a few things to pull apart there well i think i think dexlab will
33:05
will have a lot more success when they go to a subnet it's very very very hard to build essentially an order book on
33:12
chain and you know i know those guys are very impressed with that team and that going to a subnet will
33:19
make that a lot cheaper of a process for transactions and any evm based chain you
33:24
know there's only so much you can do in terms of fees so putting that on a subnet will create a lot lower
33:30
transactions which actually creates more liquidity and lower fees it's a nice dynamic but but the question i think is
33:37
about liquidity and don't forget even if you have a central limit order book you still need to attract liquidity it's
33:42
just different you just need you need people to put limit orders on buy side and sell side that is in effect
33:47
liquidity so you either need to pay a market maker to do that for you as a service or you
33:52
need to have people to have a reason to put bids and offers onto the onto the stack so
33:58
um it's a different way of doing liquidity than a traditional dex pool but it still
34:05
is the same thing uh what would be another option to for a
34:11
protocol to own its own liquidity besides models like on finance or wonderland
34:17
like these these models have been like like quantity systems is there another way
34:22
that's a good question so um protocol on liquidity can be achieved in many ways right as a protocol you
34:29
generally have a treasury allocation or you have fees going to that treasury and what i've seen some protocols do is they
34:35
actually take fees that they're generating from the protocol to buy their own token to then
34:41
put in the pool right so you do this over time and that's actually a very natural and
34:46
sustainable way to do it it's effectively like hey i'm making this revenue for my protocol i'm taking this
34:52
money and i'm actually using putting it to use for the users for me and i think
34:57
that's a very natural and sustainable way to do it hi sorry um in game five we should we
35:03
usually have two tokens one from governance and one from redwoods how do you see to make that cross chain because
35:10
you mentioned that curve is an excellent example about a good development of that
35:15
but if we already if we are developing a metabolism that should be
35:20
increased mass adoptions uh through the games and usual mechanics about defy
35:26
how do you see to develop that economics cross chain oh very good question um
35:33
i think there's going to be a few things as it relates to cross chain i'm hopeful that new technologies like
35:40
layer 0 and other types of bridges which allow you to have native swaps across chains will actually make it such that
35:47
you don't need to move liquidity to all the chains necessarily so that's a hope but not very
35:52
doesn't really exist today or it hasn't happened at scale yet
35:58
so i i do think that's a natural issue but one thing i would say about going across changes at a high level only do
36:05
it if you have to um only do it if there's a reason to i see too many projects who are like oh we're going a
36:11
polygon we're going to avalanche we're going to just because they feel like they have to be in all these chains it's not necessarily the case if you don't
36:17
have a reason to do outreach on a specific chain there's no reason to just deploy your dap there
36:23
for no reason and i always tell a lot of applications like gmx is a good example of this they started an arbitrary and
36:28
came to avalanche they could be on every chain right now they haven't done that because they're being meaningful about the change that they launched on it
36:34
requires a lot of bd time um business development time and marketing for the specific community on that chain
36:41
so you want to spend time there you want to get to know all the other dapps a lot of times what i notice is a is a dap
36:47
that goes multi-chain too fast ends up being a master of no chain has no relationships with the other
36:53
protocols on that chain and ends up like getting lost in the sea so you want to you want to be thoughtful about that
36:58
thank you very much sure that's it
37:04
all right thanks guys [Applause]

Tokenomics Design Framework Walkthrough:
(source: https://youtu.be/yPtSAL5FxPg?si=VzeAyAX6__SxZgtZ)



0:00
tokenomics design framework
0:02
so we've
0:03
yeah we've done a few consulting
0:05
projects and we've worked with
0:09
a few clients
0:10
on designing their token and we've
0:12
basically read a lot about tokenomics
0:14
written about tokenomics and so we
0:15
thought
0:17
something like this
0:18
um
0:19
in this scale doesn't really exist so
0:22
lots of people might want to go and
0:23
design their own tokenomics and um
0:26
yeah
0:27
maybe they don't have the budget for
0:29
premium consulting maybe they just want
0:31
to try it on their own
0:32
so we thought
0:34
we can give this to everybody who wants
0:36
to try on their own
0:38
so this framework will take you to
0:39
through seven steps that we think are
0:41
necessary to design
0:43
a token there might be some more and
0:46
this is a living document right so we'll
0:48
constantly publish updates to this as we
0:50
as we move along this is pretty much
0:52
really our our mvp
0:54
number one right so the minimum viable
0:56
product we'll build it out from here but
0:58
this is uh kind of our start with this
1:01
right so
1:02
um we we chose fig jam could have chosen
1:06
miro or other tools like that but we
1:08
think this
1:09
is really really cool to collaborate so
1:11
you can download this i'll link it in
1:13
the show notes you can download this
1:15
thing and then you can
1:17
create clone your own copy you can use
1:20
fig jam with this for free you can share
1:22
it with your team members and you can
1:23
work on this collaboratively
1:26
collaboratively so you can add comments
1:28
um
1:29
uh yeah
1:31
you can add notes you can get really
1:32
creative with all this i think this is
1:34
the perfect
1:35
um working mode for something like
1:37
designing a
1:38
token um
1:41
yeah and ideally you'd start from the
1:43
stop from the top right seven steps here
1:45
you can go through
1:47
and
1:48
if you need any help
1:50
you can of course
1:52
come into our discord and that's
1:54
completely free you can
1:57
you can join us you can ask a question
1:59
and um yeah you might might get some
2:02
really good answers so that
2:03
you can you can definitely try that but
2:05
if you want some more
2:07
yeah special support or some more
2:09
professional or dedicated support to
2:11
your specific use case we've got a few
2:12
packages here in case you're interested
2:15
anyway so this is
2:17
where we start we start with business
2:19
assessment and the business assessment
2:21
is to us is like really really
2:23
important
2:25
um since
2:26
yeah yeah a token is really only the
2:28
thing that you build on top of something
2:31
that that works and should add value and
2:33
so we'll go through that what's the
2:35
problem you're solving
2:36
and so generally this document is is
2:38
structured in the in the in the
2:40
different steps see here number one
2:42
there's a little video where i walk
2:44
through
2:44
uh the details of this specific step
2:47
then
2:48
we've got a
2:50
an example for unit swap and then we've
2:52
got here some space where you can get
2:54
creative like basically pulling out
2:56
these post-its typing something in it
2:58
you can share that with your with your
3:00
teammates and can collaborate on it and
3:02
i highly recommend the comment function
3:04
so i can add a comment here
3:06
um you can even link people that are
3:08
working on this with you
3:09
uh yeah so this is this is kind of
3:11
really cool on what uh fig jam has to
3:14
offer
3:15
and we're planning on getting more of
3:17
these examples for different protocols
3:19
because
3:20
yeah eunice what we just thought it was
3:22
good because everybody's familiar with
3:24
it
3:25
but um maybe not everybody knows uni
3:28
swap or maybe uniswop doesn't fit to
3:29
what you're trying to build so we're
3:30
trying to get more of these and we'll
3:32
put them in future future versions
3:35
so
3:36
the questions we're going to look at in
3:38
the business assessment is the problem
3:40
statement so we want to
3:41
have you
3:42
to look at what problem is your project
3:45
solving
3:46
and um
3:49
yeah how
3:50
are you going to solve that problem and
3:52
write that down right for unit swap that
3:53
could be um
3:55
we're going to swap
3:56
there's something the problem of
3:57
swapping tokens in a decentralized
3:59
non-custodial way
4:01
and
4:02
then we want you to look into your value
4:04
proposition your value creation so how
4:07
what do you sell what is the value that
4:09
they create that someone else is willing
4:11
to pay for
4:12
and um what's that competitive advantage
4:15
so really work on a few of these things
4:17
and for uniswap's definitely the deep
4:18
liquidity um connecting people who have
4:22
liquidity with people who want liquidity
4:24
and um
4:26
yeah so they go through that the last
4:28
step would be to think about growth
4:30
um so we really want you to get
4:33
thinking about
4:34
how your project can or will grow and
4:36
evolve
4:37
and really in this step do not think
4:40
about the token
4:41
just try
4:42
and go at this purely from a business
4:44
perspective right like how will your
4:46
project not the token because this is
4:48
important right because you want your
4:50
token to
4:51
support these things um but your token
4:54
is not the product and that's pretty
4:56
much the theme of the second step which
4:58
we call token evaluation
5:00
it's thinking about
5:02
um
5:03
maya you you wouldn't be doing this
5:04
whole design framework tokenomics design
5:06
framework if if you didn't have a token
5:08
in mind right so it
5:10
this is this is a good place to start
5:13
uh to
5:15
just think about how a token could
5:17
potentially improve your product
5:20
and if you need one at all
5:22
right it like will save you a lot of
5:24
time if you stop here
5:25
um and and think well maybe i don't need
5:28
a token yet maybe i'll go back to step
5:30
number one business assessment and try
5:32
and get my business right or get an idea
5:34
of what i'm trying to build right before
5:36
i launch a token i think this would help
5:38
a lot of people to get there so yeah
5:40
there's some
5:42
questions here that you can ask and you
5:44
can go through
5:45
and
5:48
there's we've also put in some
5:51
examples for uniswap again
5:53
um perhaps it is incentivizing ecosystem
5:57
participants
5:58
um
6:00
with something that is not as capital
6:02
intensive as as fiat right so they might
6:04
want to print some tokens that they can
6:07
give out to people to incentivize them
6:08
to do something
6:10
as a form of like
6:11
raising time or raising money and
6:14
incentivizing others so think about that
6:16
how
6:17
a token could improve your product and
6:19
there's also
6:20
an interesting question you borrowed
6:21
from madi stacks who has designed the
6:24
tokenomics design canvas which i highly
6:26
recommend checking out it's pretty cool
6:27
as well
6:30
what will having a token enable the
6:32
project to uniquely achieve compared to
6:34
some other medium of exchange like usdc
6:36
so we often see that right like people
6:39
want to implement a token to to trade
6:41
and
6:42
the first question we ask like can we do
6:44
this with a stablecoin
6:46
and if we can then what are
6:49
the things that you want additionally
6:51
that you might need a token for so go go
6:52
through a few of these things and and
6:54
yeah hopefully that will make you think
6:55
about if you need a token at all
6:58
number three is is users that's
7:01
obviously the core
7:03
of any product and also of the token
7:06
because with the token we're essentially
7:08
trying to
7:09
incentivize
7:10
um
7:11
certain behaviors within people people
7:13
that interact with our ecosystem
7:15
and so here
7:17
this is what we're going to think
7:18
through
7:19
you can check out the video i'll walk
7:21
through the details of that
7:23
and
7:25
for the user we're going to
7:27
go through a couple of different steps
7:29
and we've
7:30
got this thing we call the circle model
7:32
where we
7:34
try and map out
7:35
from the user
7:36
inside to outside
7:39
who the users are what they do
7:43
what tasks they fulfill in the ecosystem
7:44
then we can look at empathy maps to go a
7:46
little bit deeper this is a bonus step
7:47
but
7:48
yeah we recommend doing it then
7:52
we want to look at
7:53
why they use
7:54
why they would use our product why these
7:56
different users would use our product
7:58
what their motivation is we can look at
8:00
behavioral insights to go a step deeper
8:02
and then of course we want to know what
8:03
value they create for a product because
8:05
that's something we might not we might
8:07
want to like amplify when they do that
8:10
so now here's here's really the step
8:12
where this might take
8:13
a bit longer and here's the part where i
8:16
guess
8:17
it is also beneficial to to team up with
8:20
your teammate and get them all into this
8:22
file asynchronously maybe go on a call
8:23
whatever
8:24
but here's an example for uniswap and
8:26
the way we like to use this is
8:31
this is just an example for one
8:34
user of uniswap is liquidity providers
8:36
of course there's also the traders or
8:38
swappers
8:39
on the other side but we just wanted to
8:41
stick with one here so
8:43
what are the what are the tasks they
8:44
perform well they provide liquidity they
8:46
set the price range they set the fees
8:48
and then
8:49
why they use the product so they maybe
8:52
want to mitigate risk by being exposed
8:54
to a pool of assets like diversification
8:57
maybe they collect fees on idle capital
8:59
so here you can kind of see how we used
9:02
in this example this circle model as we
9:04
call it
9:05
to flesh out
9:07
more and more concrete ideas on what our
9:10
ecosystem does right and we did that
9:12
with color coding the yellow one here is
9:15
uh
9:16
user research for value created
9:19
and um
9:21
yeah we in this circle we want to figure
9:23
that out for more complex evaluations
9:26
this circle model will look
9:28
uh
9:29
a lot busier right so we'll have like a
9:31
flow of thought going from
9:33
here all the way down to the mechanisms
9:35
that we want to implement and then it
9:36
might go up here with another one it
9:38
might go up here with another one that's
9:39
why i thought like a circle
9:41
is a really cool way to display this
9:44
so here on the side you might have to
9:46
zoom out a little bit
9:47
we've got the
9:49
where you can try this out so this is
9:51
just a template you can copy it for all
9:53
the users that we have there's plenty of
9:54
space
9:55
and then just go through all the users
9:56
and and fill that out
9:59
and
10:00
so
10:01
with this step number three for users we
10:04
only go to
10:05
the yellow part of the circle right how
10:08
how users create value in the next step
10:10
we want to think about incentives that's
10:12
what we call step number four
10:14
and incentives
10:15
is really
10:16
what we want the users to do what we
10:19
want them to to be doing in our
10:21
ecosystem in our project that we're
10:22
designing and
10:24
the first thing is
10:26
behaviors like what do we want the users
10:28
to do what do we not want them to do and
10:30
the the way you work on this is similar
10:32
right so we have
10:34
similar here
10:35
um
10:37
potentially you pick up where is where
10:38
you where you left
10:40
this or where you stop the in the in the
10:42
users part you look at um create an
10:44
efficient market provide deep liquidity
10:47
on a variety of assets this is the value
10:49
they create now we can look at what we
10:51
want them to do yeah of course we want
10:53
them to
10:54
um really create
10:56
deep liquidity and we don't want them to
10:58
turn
10:59
to
11:00
or leave to go to other amms for for
11:02
better fees so this is something we
11:04
might do or might might want them to do
11:07
then we go to incentives and incentives
11:09
is
11:10
something where now that we know the
11:11
behaviors and
11:13
you know we're taking you through this
11:14
step by step just to
11:17
get these i guess creative juices
11:19
flowing in all of you and
11:22
make you figure out what it actually is
11:25
that you want from your ecosystem right
11:27
so this incentive design
11:30
how do we incentive
11:31
incentivize um these desired behaviors
11:34
and this could be like
11:35
anything carrots and sticks right we we
11:37
want to reward early liquidities we want
11:39
to pay them a competitive fee it doesn't
11:41
all have to like keep the don't
11:43
necessarily have to have the token in
11:45
mind here you can really think about
11:47
anything that
11:48
would go to incentivize these behaviors
11:52
then we then we move on to
11:54
mechanism design which and and
11:56
mechanisms
11:57
is like
11:58
taking these perhaps a little bit
12:01
abstract incentives
12:03
and
12:04
refining or defining them in more
12:05
concrete implementable
12:08
way
12:09
it's almost like as if you could if you
12:11
could program this so getting getting
12:12
into more details of how
12:14
um this thing could work and uh
12:17
yeah so this is something you know we
12:19
want to reward this early liquidity this
12:21
is an incentive that we have here we
12:24
want to pay them for that in in the unit
12:25
swap example
12:27
and then
12:28
so a mechanism could maybe be that we
12:30
and we're going to flush that out later
12:32
it could be that we want to
12:34
um
12:35
bootstrap the liquidity by paying early
12:40
early
12:41
early joiners that provide liquidity
12:43
maybe we do that for a couple of months
12:45
and um
12:47
yeah and then see how that mechanism
12:48
will work so this is an idea for a
12:50
mechanism that we could implement
12:52
and then we
12:54
kind of in a feedback loop here we want
12:56
to think about what the side effects
12:59
would be of that right so here in this
13:01
case i think this is what in the early
13:03
stages of these of d5 in general where
13:05
in this whole
13:08
yield farming
13:10
ecosystem
13:11
what went wrong is that
13:14
too many of them
13:15
were were kind of bootstrapping
13:18
but then once the tokens ran out
13:21
everything collapsed because there was
13:22
no real
13:24
thing behind it and i think what unisa
13:25
whoop did great was or did rather well
13:29
was
13:29
um
13:31
weaning off
13:32
the people who use the platform quickly
13:34
enough right so now you don't get paid
13:37
any uni tokens for using or providing
13:39
liquidity on uni swap so they quickly
13:41
got them off of that again
13:42
so maybe they've yeah thought about
13:45
these side effects so that was perhaps a
13:47
good thing so
13:48
again like think through that and um
13:51
this can take some time so you'll go
13:53
through that for all of the users that
13:55
you have and then build out this thing
13:57
and this can go into all sorts of
13:58
directions and create a lot of things
14:00
just really like about thinking through
14:02
all of this still and getting creative
14:05
ideating um yeah
14:08
next um the core mechanism summary
14:11
we want to now look at what the main
14:13
mechanisms are that we have and how
14:17
um
14:18
they work in detail so this is like a
14:19
little score card that we have
14:22
for uni swap we said well there's a
14:24
liquidity provider we want to provide
14:26
some tokens we call that a source
14:29
and then
14:30
we want to only do that until we reach a
14:32
critical mass of deep enough liquidity
14:35
to have good slippage to attract users
14:37
to come to our platform and swap tokens
14:40
so maybe describe that there's a couple
14:42
of questions prompts that get you
14:44
thinking
14:45
of what this thing will do so we can
14:47
hopefully summarize a couple of
14:48
mechanisms here
14:50
and then
14:53
some i think this is optional i think
14:55
this is always really good to
14:57
rethink what you've done just to try and
14:59
visualize it and also share it with
15:01
others is it making a is a
15:03
mapping out your mechanisms in something
15:05
like a diagram
15:06
we've got some links here
15:09
on existing ones that you can clone and
15:11
check out
15:12
and
15:14
here's one for uniswap
15:15
right which explains it sort of in a way
15:20
and then we go to step number five which
15:22
is the token value accrual
15:24
so
15:25
a lot of the the user and the incentive
15:28
part
15:29
will be concerning
15:30
the
15:31
the distribution
15:33
maybe or will
15:34
yeah we'll be more focused on the supply
15:36
side in in in some cases
15:39
so here we want to try and tie this
15:41
together if because we can't only give
15:43
away tokens we also have to have some
15:45
things that maybe create demand for a
15:47
token and um
15:50
look into how
15:52
the value that we create that we defined
15:54
in the very beginning the value that our
15:55
project our business creates how that
15:58
then accrues to the token
16:00
so yeah um we think it's a good idea
16:04
and we don't want to get into any
16:06
like modeling or simulation here
16:09
that's probably we're still trying to
16:10
figure out a way on how to
16:12
get this across to
16:15
people so that they can diy it we think
16:17
cad cat
16:18
might be might be a cool solution here
16:20
but it's far from
16:22
um
16:24
far from at a stage where everybody can
16:26
just go and diy
16:28
cod cat uh you need to know how to
16:30
program and you know how to do an
16:32
agent-based simulation or monte carlo
16:34
simulation and that's just stuff that
16:37
not everybody knows and that's quite
16:39
complicated to do so we're kind of
16:41
thinking through still and might add
16:44
something in this area in the future so
16:46
for the time being we think it's it's
16:49
pretty cool to
16:50
or pretty good to just take stock first
16:53
so look at this unit swap example we now
16:56
have
16:57
hopefully in users and incentives we've
16:59
designed a couple of mechanisms that
17:02
create supply that distribute um tokens
17:05
and then we might have also
17:07
created a bunch of mechanisms that
17:10
remove tokens or make users hold tokens
17:14
there's a there's a quite difference
17:16
here right you could burn tokens like
17:18
ethereum's eip 1559
17:22
or you could also have this like just
17:23
temporary holding of tokens
17:25
um through a mechanism
17:27
that
17:28
does something like membership
17:29
membership for for people to join your
17:32
platform they have to hold a certain
17:33
number of tokens so that of course they
17:35
wouldn't it wouldn't remove them for the
17:36
to the from the platform but it would to
17:38
some degree
17:40
um
17:41
make users if you have a growing user
17:43
base it would make them hold them uh for
17:46
some time so again there's a uniswap
17:48
example here
17:50
and
17:51
um
17:53
you can come up with your own here so
17:55
use the the cards
17:57
that we have up here
17:58
maybe just summarize them again and then
18:00
pop them on here and think through what
18:02
you have
18:04
which we call taking stock
18:07
then
18:08
once we've done that we want to really
18:10
now think about
18:11
if this is balance because that's the
18:13
whole point of the exercise um of course
18:15
we're not going to quantify that and
18:17
that's something we're working on that
18:18
we hopefully um
18:21
well i don't i don't know if you're ever
18:22
going to solve it because quantifying it
18:23
is really really difficult especially in
18:25
complex systems
18:27
but to get closer to that point but but
18:29
anyway maybe let's we'll start really
18:30
simple here so we have our supply
18:32
mechanism on the one side we have our
18:33
demand mechanisms on the other side and
18:36
now we can try and balance them think
18:37
about um
18:39
how well we think this would be balanced
18:42
out are there enough users coming in
18:44
that would buy the new token because our
18:46
product is really good or
18:48
what else have we thought of that would
18:51
happen here
18:54
and
18:55
yeah then we can think about other
18:56
things that we might implement right so
18:58
ethereum has gone through a similar
18:59
process where they
19:01
um
19:02
had quite inflationary tokenomics and
19:05
they
19:06
they decided in
19:08
when they decided that i think like in
19:10
august or july last year is that that
19:12
long they decided to um implement
19:14
eip1559
19:16
with which
19:17
um now tokens get burned um
19:21
off of every transaction that happens
19:24
and so
19:25
that would be something that's more like
19:27
an external demand driver right because
19:30
we're taking tokens out of circulation
19:31
based on that but they're also me maybe
19:34
like additional utilities for your token
19:36
that you could implement that would do
19:38
something with your
19:39
um token to balance the supply and
19:42
demand here a little bit better
19:43
so yeah add that to this thing
19:45
um to this sheet
19:47
and
19:48
try and get an idea for that then we get
19:50
to step number six which
19:52
yeah really almost gets us to the end of
19:54
our
19:55
of our design framework and this is the
19:58
distribution so first of all we want to
20:00
look at allocation so who are
20:03
we know our mechanisms and the
20:04
mechanisms will require some tokens that
20:06
we have to allocate to certain pools but
20:08
now there might be additional people
20:10
that you need to give tokens to maybe
20:11
there's some investors that you have to
20:13
give some to
20:14
team members other parts the community
20:16
maybe you want to air drop to a certain
20:18
group to
20:19
to get them onboarded
20:20
um
20:21
so yeah that's something uniswop has
20:23
done that with their one billion tokens
20:25
and we have um a calculation template
20:28
here which you can just
20:29
click on and clone
20:31
um
20:32
it's on google sheets and there's just
20:34
this simple table here right where you
20:36
can come up with the different holders
20:37
that you think you need to have and
20:39
there are locations so it's coming with
20:41
some number of tokens that you want and
20:43
then
20:44
think through how you would allocate
20:46
that
20:47
this is really this step which is
20:49
probably not too difficult the next one
20:52
then concerns
20:54
the timing all right so if you think
20:56
about supply and demand we have
20:59
our mechanisms that supply tokens we
21:01
have then also people that we allocate
21:04
tokens to like investors
21:05
and so this all adds tokens to
21:08
circulation
21:09
and we have the demand side which yeah
21:11
maybe lock up some tokens or take them
21:13
out or have people hold them
21:16
because they see
21:17
value in the token
21:20
what we now need to do is to map that
21:22
onto
21:23
onto time because that's the most
21:25
important thing
21:26
is like
21:27
if you dump all your tokens onto the
21:29
market day one
21:30
then yeah you probably won't have enough
21:33
demand for the token if you bring it all
21:34
to onto
21:35
too slowly you might not be able to
21:37
raise
21:38
um funds or to bootstrap your ecosystem
21:41
the way you want to so timing is really
21:43
really important
21:45
and we hope that the
21:47
supply demand
21:50
mapping or balance that you've done here
21:53
will help
21:54
in trying to figure out
21:56
how to
21:57
um yeah emit tokens in a way that that
22:00
is balanced so again you can use this
22:02
calculation template
22:04
it's
22:05
it's not perfect but
22:07
um
22:08
we have
22:10
tried to yeah give you some numbers
22:13
crunching
22:15
spreadsheet where you can
22:17
map supply and demand against each other
22:19
so you know your supply kind of how many
22:21
tokens will come onto the market in what
22:23
time and you can sort of also estimate
22:26
where demand for the token could come
22:28
from so it could be from investors or
22:30
speculators it could be from maybe you
22:32
have a token membership
22:33
uh maybe have some other utility that
22:36
you think would make people buy tokens
22:39
and so you can play around with that a
22:40
little bit and then you can try and
22:42
balance against that how quickly you
22:44
want to supply your tokens onto the
22:46
market work how quickly you have to
22:48
right your your investors will
22:49
definitely have an idea of how quickly
22:51
the or how long they want their tokens
22:53
to be locked up so yeah think about all
22:56
that
22:56
and try and
22:58
mess around with that in the spreadsheet
23:00
to get a good understanding
23:01
um
23:04
unit swap again there's an example it's
23:05
probably not
23:07
so useful
23:09
um
23:10
but you you get an idea right that they
23:13
they started in september 20
23:15
and they've got four years of vesting so
23:17
the one billion tokens that they have
23:19
will have four years until they're
23:21
completely
23:22
in circulation
23:24
so um yeah there's some other sources
23:26
here that you could look into there's
23:28
like one source that was really good
23:29
that
23:31
did like the optimal investing schedule
23:32
so there's lots of cool stuff that you
23:34
can look into here and find out more
23:35
about how quickly or slowly you want to
23:37
distribute your tokens
23:39
and then
23:40
token launch yeah
23:42
there's a whole bunch of additional
23:44
questions that you'll have to solve
23:46
and
23:47
for that
23:49
we have some resources we have some
23:51
questions that you go through
23:53
um
23:54
but yeah at that point it might be good
23:56
talking to maybe your
23:59
venture capitalists or some market
24:01
makers to find out what liquidity
24:04
you will need for your token
24:06
when launching it that's kind of
24:09
based on market cap of your token where
24:12
yeah we're trying to
24:13
get this
24:15
section 6.3 bit more fleshed out to help
24:18
you more maybe with a calculation
24:19
template as well
24:21
um so you can go through
24:23
uh yeah that calculation
24:25
but
24:27
this is what you need to know here right
24:28
find out what your price of the token
24:30
what price your token you want to have
24:32
what market cap you want to launch at
24:33
and for that market cap how much
24:36
liquidity you need and for that you can
24:37
for a lot of cases just look into
24:39
uniswap look at other comparative tokens
24:42
that are at the market cap that you want
24:44
your token to be at let's say you want
24:46
your targeting for 100 million
24:48
then just go to unit swap and look for
24:50
other tokens that are trading around 100
24:52
million and find out what liquidity they
24:54
have for their main token pairs
24:56
so that's a good point to start
24:59
yeah
25:00
i guess this is how you could sort of
25:02
approach that and then step number seven
25:05
we think is a really important one
25:08
is documenting it all because there's so
25:10
many tokens out there
25:12
that trading at high valuations and they
25:14
just
25:15
have terrible terrible
25:16
uh documentation what their token does
25:18
it doesn't help investors and it doesn't
25:20
help other builders that are building
25:22
tokens um to learn from what you've done
25:25
and so
25:26
i've got this template here you can
25:28
download it you can and then it if
25:30
you've downloaded it or cloned it
25:32
then it will refer to sections of this
25:35
tokenomics design framework and you can
25:37
look into the different sections and
25:38
copy out the stuff that you have
25:40
discovered and put it into this thing
25:42
and then you can use this light paper to
25:44
share it with investors and
25:47
upload it on your website
25:48
and have it available for for other
25:51
builders so they can learn from what
25:52
your project did
25:54
that's it that's the tokonomi's design
25:56
framework um i hope you like this
25:58
walkthrough
26:00
uh we'd love to get some feedback if you
26:02
have any if there's anything that's
26:04
missing or not working or you'd like to
26:06
see in future versions
26:07
don't be shy reach out to us here and
26:10
give us some feedback and if you need
26:11
any help also
26:13
go to our website there's a contact form
26:15
you can reach out to us and um yeah we
26:17
can see what is best to help you out

How to Design an Automated Market Maker (AMM) in Machinations:
(source: https://youtu.be/SGPXL8_-y1E?si=woQVA1HOG45Zr45a)



0:00
good afternoon good evening good morning wherever you are in the world welcome to today's session really pleased to be
0:05
here and finally share some amn models with everybody so today we're going to be walking through how to design an
0:11
automated market maker in machinations and we've got a jam-packed agenda today
0:17
so i'm gonna walk through and give do a little bit of an introductions to amms um and kind of explain how they came
0:23
into existence and what the the kind of the challenge that they're solving then i'm gonna build a amm step by step and
0:31
show you how to build it then i'm going to run you through a kind of a fully featured amm
0:36
and explain how it's uh all the different ways in which they can be used and all the different kind of maths and
0:43
logic that are involved in them then i'm going to walk through a much more simplified version uh i've spent a
0:49
long time trying to make it as simple as possible and i think i've kind of got it down to less than 40 objects
0:55
for a nice simple amm you can use in your model straight away and then we're going to come to talk
1:01
about some of the assumptions and error margins and how to mitigate them in our models so that you can be best prepared
1:07
to handle them and this is the end point we're going to get to today i'm going to show you this
1:13
first just because it might look intimidating but as we kind of walk through the model you're actually going to find it it's very simple
1:20
uh amms are one of these very simple things but they can be quite complicated at the same time so
1:27
by the time we finish the day you'll be able to build this model my name is matthew i'm the evangelist for mac nations been kicking around the
1:34
games industry for a while please do come and follow me on the nations community
1:40
i'll post that link into the chat later and alongside me today as always it's
1:45
cesar our resident machinations expert who will be going through helping me answer any questions that
1:52
come up uh and kind of monitoring chat as we go along through today and there's also horia lurking about in
2:00
the in the chat as well keeping an eye on any q a that we get gonna have plenty of time for q a today
2:07
uh but please if you have any questions be great if you could ask them in the chat or in the q a function
2:12
um down the bottom in fact i can see uh some questions that have come in already
2:18
uh all the models i'm going to show you today will be available uh in
2:24
on my profile we're gonna publish them as templates uh later on today or in fact immediately
2:29
maybe even during the session we'll do that so what is an amm uh and actually before we
2:37
even get into what is an amm i'm going to talk about stock exchanges and how they work
2:42
quite simple uh we have people who selling uh stock in a company uh or some kind of
2:51
investment they go to a stock market and say this is what i would like to sell my stock at somebody else goes along to the
2:57
same exchange and they say i would like to buy this stock at this price the stock exchange matches those orders
3:04
together and they take a fee for that service that's been going on since the 18th
3:09
century it's a very successful model it trades very well obviously the biggest ones kind of being london new york stock
3:15
exchange frankfurt and so on now when it comes to crypto it then started to be a bit of a
3:22
problem because there weren't enough people kind of going in offering to buy and sell these things regularly so it
3:28
started to cause kind of friction in and kind of people having confidence
3:33
that if they were to buy into some of these um different tokens or different crypto
3:39
what impact it would then have if they couldn't then find somebody to buy or sell it
3:44
and so this came out so let's run on chain decentralized exchanges that
3:49
weren't the way we run prediction markets and that's a direct quote so very few people probably know about this
3:56
this was when amms were pretty much in first mentioned anywhere on the internet
4:01
which is where this was posted on reddit uh and kind of
4:07
proposed this whole idea uh and i'll post this link to the chat at some point during today's
4:13
session so you can have a look at it um my favorite comment in there is that you know this
4:19
rather obscure reddit post basically created a multi-billion dollar
4:24
marketplace and this is really the kind of the key part that we're going to be walking
4:29
through today which is this formula a times b equals k and the kind of variations of this and
4:36
the kind of the core principles of an amm so
4:41
let's get into it and let's build an amm in machinations
4:46
so we've got a nice blank canvas and we're going to kick off and build an
4:52
amm so the first step uh of an amm is obviously
4:58
liquidity and the kind of this uh typically is often in the form of two
5:05
um two pulls one of them being the token that we're going to have inside our game
5:11
the other one being uh the crypto currency that we're going to be connecting to
5:16
so one on my left here i'm going to call this my token and the one on the right i'm going to
5:22
call this crypto because the most common use case that we certainly see
5:28
are when we're looking to understand a um a game economy so we've got some kind of
5:35
token that's inside the game and this is going to be exchange out of the game economy to some kind of cryptocurrency
5:42
and we'll talk about those in more detail as we go this session someone just asked how long
5:47
this session is going to be we've got scheduled for an hour we'll see how we get on i think i'll probably talk for
5:52
about 35 minutes and then you'll get bored of me
5:58
so one of the things i find really helpful in machinations is that you can
6:04
put words into these state connections rather than having the letters um and i find this really helpful in
6:10
order to kind of keep track of um our formulas now i'm going to keep this fairly
6:16
generic so i'm going to put in 50 000 tokens into my liquidity
6:22
on both sides to start off with then this is my formula so for this
6:30
i'm going to do token times crypto and
6:35
this is going to be my k number so that starting point
6:40
if i hit step this is going to take 50 000 tokens 50 000 crypto multiply those
6:46
together to give me a k number of two and a half billion
6:52
in total now i'm going to remove these at the moment
7:02
now it's kind of a couple of different ways that um
7:07
we can then interact with our liquidity pools both of them are going to involve either putting in tokens and taking out
7:14
crypto or putting in crypto taking out tokens the normal kind of trade
7:20
now for the most part um we're going to be not too worried about the crypto
7:27
and how many tokens we kind of we've got going around in circulation of crypto the most part they're external to our
7:33
game economy so we're not going to worry about them so in this case i'm going to be just using a source
7:39
and a drain to track how many
7:44
uh our kind of entry and exit of crypto from our amm
7:51
but for our token i'm then going to use another pool i'm going to call this
7:57
tokens in game
8:03
and these are going to come in to the top here to try and keep it neat i'm going to
8:08
root these round so that they look like they're coming in and then as we take them out of the
8:15
uh amm i'm going to route them back around so they go back out to here
8:22
now obviously if we're building a full game economy we might have a whole bunch of
8:28
metrics that are going to determine how many tokens are going to be bought and sold each step
8:33
but just to keep this really simple i'm going to do a uh a little random number generator
8:40
so i'm just going to have a source a pool and a drain i'm going to make both the source and the drain automatic
8:46
i'm going to make label on there all so it'll remove all of the resources in there
8:52
then i'm going to put in a d1000 so that will give me a number between
8:57
1 and 1 000 each step so if i hit play on this now this random
9:03
number generator is just going to tick over and it's going to flash up a different random number each step so i'm just
9:10
using that to kind of create me some data of how many tokens are we going to be selling into our amm each step
9:19
so we've determined how many we're going to be selling into the amm
9:26
so i'm going to create myself a little register i could take this directly from the pool
9:33
but i'm going to explain why i'm doing this in a separate register for a moment uh and i'm going to call this t sold so
9:40
number of tokens that i'm sending each step and then here i'm going to call that t sold as well in
9:47
my formula so now i've got whatever number's coming up in here is going to come up with my
9:52
register and now i'm going to pop this as an override
10:01
so that if i make this automatic and hit play
10:06
however many tokens i'm getting here will then be pulled over from my tokens
10:11
in the game so i better put some uh tokens there for now we'll just stick a
10:18
five five million tokens i'll do so now each step whatever number i'm randomly
10:24
generating will be taken into my token port now putting tokens in we're going to
10:29
have to take tokens crypto out to rebalance our
10:34
amm and the really important fact of an amm
10:39
is this number that we have here which is our two and a half billion we want this number to stay the same all the
10:44
time that's our constant regardless of how we trade or how many tokens we put
10:50
in how many tokens we take out that number's always going to stay the same
10:56
so in order to work out how many uh crypto we then need to take out of our amm based on the
11:03
number of tokens we're putting in we need to do some maths now
11:09
the part that probably took me the longest to get my head around when we went
11:14
when i was trying to understand amms for the very first time and i was kind of trying to understand them is that
11:21
uh in most ways when you buy or sell something the price is calculated at the start of
11:28
that transaction whereas with the amm the way i think about it is really whenever you're doing a trade with the
11:34
amm you're calculating the price as if it was the end of that transaction
11:40
and let me explain that in a little bit more detail so if we take the number of tokens that we have inside
11:48
the amm so i'm going to label that say collection token and then we take the number of tokens
11:54
that we're going to be adding in so in this case that's my t sold label
12:00
and in here i'm then going to put my token plus t sold
12:07
if i hit step on this for a moment this is now going to show me that okay if we're going to add
12:13
521 tokens in the next step that means that in total in our uh token
12:19
pool they'll be five 5 50 twenty one
12:24
uh tokens there now that's gonna upset the number of uh what the k number is therefore i need
12:32
to rebalance my k number based off of this number so the way i can then calculate this is
12:38
to take my uh k factor and i'll root this
12:44
trying to keep it neat so i'm going to label that
12:50
k so in my formula box here for this register i'm now going to do k
12:56
divided by token plus token sold
13:03
so now what this is calculating it's saying that well we know that the k is token
13:09
multiplied by crypto therefore if we add 521 tokens
13:16
to this pool in the next step we need to adjust the number of tokens
13:22
in our crypto pool to 49 800 484
13:28
so that's the bit i think is the most confusing i'll once i finish this off we'll go through
13:33
it a couple of times just to make sure that that logic is making sense
13:40
so this now gives us a new balance so i'm going to go with new crypto
13:46
balance in this register
13:52
and then i'm going to add another register over here
13:58
and from here i'm going to run a state connection
14:05
i'm going to call this state connection new crypto
14:11
and we also if we this is giving us the number of crypto that it should be
14:17
we also need to know well how many crypto are in that pool at the moment therefore we're going to grab another
14:23
state connection from our crypto pool and i'm going to call this one crypto
14:34
and in here and then i then want to calculate in this register how many resources
14:41
we're going to take out and send to our drain so the first thing i'm going to do is make mark that at zero
14:48
add myself another state connection into here with that override as an
14:54
equals and in my formula box i'm then going to say okay well i need to know the
15:00
difference between those two numbers that for my formula is crypto
15:06
minus nu crypto so this is then generated for me 515.
15:17
now that we've got that set up i'm gonna make my drain automatic for a moment
15:24
and we should be now ready to see that trade happen so what's going to happen is we're going
15:29
to put in 521 uh tokens and in order to rebalance our k number
15:36
we're going to remove 515 crypto
15:42
there we go that transaction has now taken place our two token pools and our liquidity have
15:49
been adjusted and our k factor is still exactly the same number
15:55
the next transaction is 657 so i'm taking my t sold number my token
16:02
sold number of 657 and that's how many resources we're
16:08
going to input into the token pool in our new crypto balance
16:15
it means that our tokens plus tokens sold and then we're dividing that k number of
16:20
two and a half billion by those two added up together this gives us a new balance that we need to
16:27
have in crypto pool of 48 848
16:32
and over here when we look at the difference between what's in our crypto pool right now and
16:39
how many tokens it should be that difference is 635
16:44
therefore in the next step that's how many resources we're going to take out are you following me chezza this is
16:51
making sense to you it is making sense to me
16:57
i'm not sure if everyone is following but it is it's a pretty pretty mathematical
17:05
thing in the end right it's not very i don't know it's
17:10
it's maybe hard to grasp the concept of of like
17:16
decreasing one amount you know increase one amount and take from the other but
17:22
first calculate that amount before you decrease it you know there's some order of operations in there that may cause
17:27
some confusion but other than that i think it's not very complicated yeah i mean certainly um when i first
17:34
went through this and kind of had to understand this this formula i think is
17:40
the the hardest one but really when you break it down in terms of we're always going to keep that k number
17:46
the same in order to do that we're going to work out okay this is what our balance is at the
17:53
moment this is what the balance is going to be once we've added these extra
17:58
tokens into it so if we take k divided by those two numbers
18:03
that's going to give us our new balance and this register here is just going to work out the difference between those
18:09
two and that's how much we're going to so if i hit play on this now it's gonna
18:16
carry on going we're gonna constantly do transactions where we're picking a number and we're
18:23
randomly picking a number of tokens and that's how many it's gonna remove the
18:28
corresponding amount of crypto tokens as needed now as this goes on obviously we're only
18:33
doing one-sided transactions at the moment this means that as we go further through this
18:39
uh this run the number of crypto tokens that we remove in relation to the number of
18:46
tokens that we're putting in is constantly dropping because we're making this number smaller and this is
18:53
where we start to get um the kind of the bonding curve and
18:58
that uh that price price sustainability inside
19:05
the um inside the amms the more scarce one side of the amm
19:12
it is effectively the more valuable it is so now we've done 60 odd steps i'll pause
19:19
it there for a moment and then we'll have a look at what's happened with those ratios now i started off this
19:25
simulation where the both the token pool and the crypto pool were equal this means that one token was worth one
19:32
crypto now that we're we we've got a big difference between
19:38
the two so with 699 resources going in in the next step
19:44
the number of crypto that are coming out of the amm is now uh significantly
19:49
smaller than one to one so it's now 260 that are coming out if i let this carry on playing that
19:56
ratio is going to continue to change and to the point where we have to put
20:01
more and more tokens in to get the diminishing number of crypto back out of
20:07
the amm that making sense so far
20:16
so the next thing we want to do with our amm and once we've kind of understood this kind
20:23
of this core logic the important thing we want to know is what are tokens going to be worth
20:29
and for this we then need to understand well what's our crypto worth
20:35
so first up let's just set a value for what each crypto um
20:42
token or coin is worth so for this i'm going to do this in
20:47
cents and we're going to do a us dollar tied coin
20:53
so let's do usdt
20:58
and i'm then going to have a register and this register is going to look at well
21:05
what's my price so i'm going to set this as price
21:11
i'm going to set uh i'm going to need to know how many crypto tokens we
21:17
have in there so again i'm going to put another uh state connection
21:23
with crypto on it um it might sound like a bit of extra work
21:28
going through and labeling these state connections each time but i really find it makes a makes life much easier in the
21:35
long run when you when you're going back looking at a model and you're trying to remember where these state connections come from
21:41
so i just find it just makes my life easier now the value of each token
21:48
is going to be with a formula of what's the price of each token of each
21:53
crypto sorry so price multiplied by crypto
21:58
pop some brackets around it and then that's going to be divided by token
22:04
so what this is now going to do this formula is going to look at okay the value of the tokens
22:11
is worth whatever the value of the crypto is uh in total so if we then take the the
22:17
number of tokens that we have in our liquidity pool and we do this calculation it's then
22:23
going to calculate for us exactly how much these tokens are worth
22:30
because they're both starting off with equal liquidity so 50 000 tokens 50 000 crypto
22:38
the number of the price of each crypto is a hundred cents or one dollar
22:44
therefore the price of each token is going to be 100. now as i leave this running
22:51
i'll zoom in a bit so we can see the number because we're constantly selling tokens into the amm and we're removing
22:58
crypto we're gonna see our the price of our uh tokens going down all the time
23:05
and i can do this with a huge number of decimal points if i wanted to we could then add a rounding or a fix or
23:13
adjust how many decimal points we were seeing but for now let's just add that into the
23:19
chart and enable us to track the price
23:24
inside the chart of our token i'll speed up this model so we can start to build up some data a little bit
23:30
faster so this is gonna show our token price constantly falling
23:40
importantly regardless of what we're doing in any of our transactions if i were to pause my simulation at any
23:47
point we're then going to go back to a club number close to two and a half
23:52
billion and while folks amongst you will notice there's a bit of a difference and i'm
23:57
going to explain that in a moment but our charts going to show this uh
24:04
nice curve and this is where we're getting that bonding curve in fact let me do this another way
24:10
i'm going to set a constant number so i'm going to make these two passive
24:15
for a moment and i'm going to put 1000
24:21
resources into here hit
24:27
clear my chart first hit play so now we've got a constant number of
24:33
tokens that are being sold uh the the amount of um crypto that's
24:41
withdrawn each time it's slightly less so this should start to create for us a
24:46
lovely curve where because we've got a constant number of tokens coming in
24:52
uh it's showing that uh that bonding curve and the relationship between the two pools
25:02
so hopefully now we've seen kind of one side of the amm i'm going to switch over to
25:09
something slightly more complicated uh let me turn off some of these layers for a moment
25:22
just to get us to the same starting point so here we are here's our starting point same sort of configuration we've
25:30
got our token we've got our crypto we've got the same uh elements to it
25:36
oh let me add that one so this is the side that we started off with what i've now
25:42
done to this is i've added um another element that you might want to think about with your amms which is the fees
25:50
for staking rewards so every every time a transaction goes through an amm there's some
25:57
fees that are taken these fees are then uh allocated to the
26:03
both the owner of the amm and also to the actual people that have staked their
26:10
tokens or their their crypto into the amm
26:15
and so if i would hit play for a moment we'll let some transactions go through
26:20
but here i'm then keeping track of how much we're actually collecting from the
26:25
amm in total rewards and this is done by adding in this extra
26:31
uh gate this gate is then splitting all the resources that go through this by 99.7
26:38
percent and then capturing 0.3 percent in transaction fees
26:45
now cesar you might want to just back me up on this as i try and explain how deterministic gates are working
26:51
with these sorts of numbers and how it maintains that correct balance between between those because obviously that's a
26:58
quite a small percentage 0.3 percent and it can mean that individual transactions
27:05
it might there will be a rounding error in here which causes the the a slight variation of how much is collected in
27:12
transaction piece do you want to just explain how those how deterministic
27:18
gates work and how it'll make sure that it maintains that balance um yeah sure so deterministic gates have
27:25
the property of always trying to balance out the resources that they send out to
27:31
try and adjust the ratios of the outputs right in this case we have uh
27:39
two outputs 99.7 and 0.3 percent if we had one billion resources coming
27:46
in let's say there will be no problem because the the two outputs would be able to to split the
27:51
resources according to that if we had say 100 resources come in here then uh
27:58
one output would need to split 99.7 resources and the other one 0.3 and that's not possible
28:04
because resources are integers in machinations uh what would happen in this case is
28:10
that the the deterministic gate would try to balance that over multiple steps so
28:16
let's say in the first step we would uh put 100 resources through the gate what
28:21
would happen is that all 100 resources would go uh towards the drain on the top and zero resources
28:28
towards transaction fee the deterministic gate however remembers that uh it sent those resources in these
28:35
proportions right 100 to zero and during the next step we'll try to to balance out uh that amount now 0.3 percent
28:44
roughly means a third of a resource let's say that so what the deterministic gate will do is over the course of three
28:51
steps it will send a single resource towards the transaction fee resource connection and all of the other towards
28:58
the uh drain at the top obviously it's not going to be every three steps every
29:03
time because it's still amounts it's still less than a third so over time it will it will amount to a bit less than
29:09
that but as a general rule that's how deterministic gates work so even if we're talking small resources over a
29:18
large number of steps they should they should
29:24
get to those ratios that are specified on the outputs but if we're talking a
29:29
low number of steps and a low number of resources then you might see some differences like matthew described uh
29:34
that may split the resources in an uneven way let's see
29:40
okay thank you very much cesar now
29:45
we kind of we walked through this the construction of this side a moment ago um one of the things that we're the
29:52
added kind of logic that we're um added in for this is obviously
29:58
the amount of tokens that are now coming in are being modified so we're taking
30:03
out that 0.3 so in our registers here we've taken that into
30:08
account so we're multiplying the number of uh resources in our t sold register
30:14
by that 0.997 to add in that extra 0.3 percent
30:20
so that the amount of um tokens that come into here are are then
30:26
correct and we're not losing any uh kind of detail or just losing out 0.3 percent
30:31
overall and we're keeping our our constant in the in the right way
30:37
the other side of this amm um is we've looked at setting tokens into
30:44
the liquidity pools the other way that we want to do this is to look at how many uh tokens that we can buy from the
30:52
liquidity pool and how much crypto we have to put in for this side of it
30:57
in order to do this i've got some random data sources um so these are just the just as we saw
31:04
before i've created these random number generators to generate me some numbers
31:09
um so on for this side i've got a random number generator that's saying how many
31:15
tokens are we buying each step let me do one step and we'll leave it
31:20
there so here in the next time that this is going to be used we're going to take 237
31:27
000 tokens and that's how many we're going to buy from the amm
31:33
this goes into my tokens bought and in order to counteract that
31:38
transaction fee because my game actually requires the full 237 000
31:45
i need to counteract that tax that's been taken by the amm
31:51
so therefore i'm dividing it by 0.997 to increase that number so it's
31:57
going from and thirty seven thousand two hundred and thirty eight thousand
32:04
uh so that as those that number of resources come out naught point three percent is going to go off in our
32:09
transaction fees and the rest will come out uh let me add that layer back in
32:15
so then my 99.7 is going to carry on back into my game economy
32:22
then just as we saw before we're using that k number so here i'm taking my k number
32:29
and i'm dividing it by the number of tokens that are already inside our liquidity pool
32:35
so this is coming from my 10 million tokens i have here and then i'm subtracting from that the
32:42
number of tokens that are being bought in the next step so my t bought number
32:48
so again this calculation token minus token bought that's going to show us how many
32:54
tokens should be in that liquidity pool after the transaction so then we're taking k we're dividing by
33:00
that number to find our new crypto number and our new crypto number and then
33:07
bringing over to here through this state connection and i'm saying okay i'm going
33:12
to take my my new crypto number and i'm going to subtract from this
33:17
the existing crypto number so i'm taking my how many crypto do we
33:23
have in our pool and i'm taking our new crypto number
33:28
minus what we have in there at the moment this is giving us a balance in this case two and a half billion
33:35
um and i'll explain why that's such a big number in a moment and uh what i've been doing is i've been
33:42
obviously dividing that number by 0.997 to again counteract my uh transaction b
33:49
and setting this in with a override back into my resource connection and that's
33:56
how many resources we're going to push into our liquidity pool
34:01
so it's exactly the same the same as the the first uh kind of
34:07
step-by-step process we looked at on the top of our liquidity pools here in terms of selling tokens into liquidity pool
34:14
but we've just done some uh kind of reversing of that mathematics so look at the from the other perspective of when
34:21
we're buying tokens from our liquidity pool so now if i hit play every couple of
34:27
steps here we've got different transactions going on so we've got
34:33
tokens being sold to the amm tokens being bought from the amm going back
34:38
around the other way and tracking how many token rewards we have
34:44
each step now there's two other types of
34:49
transactions that can happen with an amm and it's kind of really up to you whether or not this is something that
34:56
you want to factor into your models depending on what your objectives are
35:01
that we'll talk about in a moment and this is adding liquidity into our
35:07
um tokens now if we go back to our
35:14
uh this kind of this post from the original launch of all the the kind of concept of amms
35:22
there's this line here in the version where people can invest k can change but
35:27
only during an investment withdrawal transactions not trades so we've shown how the k number isn't
35:34
um being uh adjusted during trades but what we now want to look at is okay well if we
35:41
invest more resources into our amm obviously the k number can then change
35:50
so what i've created here in this section is a way for us to be able to visualize and understand how that's
35:57
happening in the amm so i've got a source here that's adding liquidity and another random number generator
36:04
that's going to generate me a number so i'll hit a step and what we're now doing is we're looking at
36:11
the difference between or the percentage of each of these
36:16
um of the liquidity pools so i've got 10 million tokens against 100 billion
36:22
crypto so obviously that crypto numbers significantly higher and in this case
36:28
this means that if we were to add 482 000 into the total liquidity
36:36
if i look at this formula i'm doing token divided by token plus crypto so
36:42
i'm looking at the total number added up between number of tokens the number of crypto
36:48
and then i'm dividing the number of tokens by that number to give me the percentage of tokens to total
36:56
and then i'm multiplying that by how much liquidity we're adding in that step
37:01
so this means that for us to add 48 uh tokens
37:06
and 482 000 um crypto
37:12
so if i hit play i've got a automation layer on this model as well
37:18
so just to explain what that's doing i've got a automatic gate here and this has got
37:25
some percentages uh which are then triggering these different actions each step so
37:31
i've got a 35 chance and let me show you where this is going this is going over to here to try trigger
37:38
um a sale to the amm i've got a 35 chance of this triggering
37:44
a purchase from the amm and i've got a 15 chance of it triggering a adding
37:51
liquidity event so there's one's just happen now and this is
37:56
adding liquidity to our pools because it's um keeping exactly the same ratio our t
38:04
number is increasing but when we're adding liquidity the price of our token
38:09
or the price of our crypto isn't changing at all so if i look at the same formula we have
38:15
before here i've got crypto and i've got an extra bit of maths in there that i'm
38:20
going to explain in a moment um this is then going to be calculating our price whenever we adjust the amount
38:27
of liquidity we have in our pools this price isn't going to change
38:34
then in exactly the same way we then have a removing liquidity event so this is a drain now rather than a source with
38:41
a 15 chance and what this is going to do it's going to remove liquidity in the
38:47
same ratios so just as we saw with adding liquidity whenever we remove liquidity we do that at exactly the same
38:54
ratios that are already in place and this means that we're not changing the price whenever we add or
39:01
remove liquidity does that make sense to you cesar that liquidity part
39:08
does again yeah i'm probably not the best person to
39:13
ask this that's true but please do if you have any questions i know i can see there's some questions
39:20
um kind of going through i think there's at least one question in
39:25
the q a i'm going to try and grab it in just a moment it's a big question so i'm going to take it's going to take me a
39:31
second to read it um but hopefully this is making sense
39:38
overall then here hopefully now we've been through every element of this but this is
39:44
fairly complex and it might be slightly overkill for your requirements and if
39:49
you want something quick and fast that's what we've got for you today so also going to be sharing this model
39:55
with you today which is our super cut down version of the same thing now i've got an automation layer here
40:02
that's triggering a purchase or a sale each step so i'm going to hide that for a moment and just try and focus on the
40:09
core areas that we have here in this cut down amm
40:14
so we have our token we have our crypto what i've done here is rather than
40:19
having two registers that are then used uh in fact i think we had three registers in
40:26
our full one used to do this calculation here we're doing all of this inside one step
40:32
so here we're doing um crypto and then rather than crypto minus the
40:38
new crypto balance what we're doing is we're taking that formula from the previous one and adding all of them into
40:44
here so now we're taking those tokens tokens and tokens sold adding those
40:50
together dividing the k number by that number to give us the new balance
40:55
and then doing crypto minus that part of the formula to give us the new balance
41:02
so if i just hit step uh here we're adding 171 tokens
41:08
being sold into the amm we're going through that calculation and it's equaling 170 that
41:15
are going to be removed in the next step and back on the other side of here we've
41:21
got the same thing again but all condensed into one neat little register so it's doing that same type of
41:27
calculation but this time just the other way around to look at it from the reverse perspective of buying tokens
41:34
from the amm now this is actually the perfect example and one of the key
41:40
kind of things we want to think about when we're looking at the at an amm to
41:46
understand where we could start to have issues machinations works in whole integers so
41:52
these resources that are moving around they're always whole units there's no fractions or decimal places on these
42:00
transactions so as i hit play and i let this play out for a little while
42:06
we're triggering both purchases and sales into our amm if i pause this any moment it's going to
42:13
be the same number oh it's going to be exactly the same number thank you machinations monte carlo but
42:20
what we'll start to see is because there's a rounding error and i'm using
42:26
um the round function in these registers to round this up to a whole integer
42:31
this means that we then will start to get a margin of error on our amm over multiple steps over
42:39
multiple transactions this means that we can then we might
42:45
start to cause a problem in this example uh
42:51
so this this will this will be quite interesting for you crypto folks so i uh set the price of this yesterday maybe
42:58
of where um ethereum was it's going to depress me too much to look at what the new price
43:03
of ethereum is so we'll just pretend it's yesterday and keep 1590
43:09
for an ethereum um i'm doing this in cents so i've rounded so i've actually got 159 000 cents
43:18
um to help calculate my token price now because we've got an equal number of
43:23
crypto and an equal number of tokens in here this means that at the start of my simulation our toke each token is going
43:31
to be one worth one ethereum which means that each token yesterday was worth
43:38
159 000 cents or one and a half thousand dollars
43:43
now um we might have a liquidity pool that big but what's probably slightly more
43:49
likely is rather than having um 50 000 ethereum in there we might have slightly
43:56
less so maybe we'll have 10 ethereum in there now
44:02
i'm sure it's not going to take anyone very long to work out this is going to cause us a very very serious rounding
44:08
error issue so because of that rounding error and the way in which machinations works with
44:14
whole integers we've got all these transactions going on but are the number of
44:20
crypto resources that now need to be added or removed from the liquidity pool each step is going to be
44:27
it's going to be rounding down to zero every time our token price is never going to change
44:33
our constant is going to get more and more incorrect because we're adding and removing tokens but that rounding error
44:40
means we're never changing the number of crypto that we've got um in our pool
44:46
so uh the way in which you can approach this is rather than
44:52
trying to do anything funky with this i take the number of resources that i have
44:57
in my crypto pool and say we had 10 um ethereum
45:03
in our liquidity pool what are they gonna do is i'm gonna add nine zeros onto that number so effectively multiply
45:10
it by a billion so one two three four five six seven eight nine
45:15
so we've now got 10 billion ethereum which is really 10 ethereum but
45:20
multiplied by that number and this is where i'm going to take my crypto number and i'm going to divide it by the same
45:27
amount so
45:33
now when i hit step uh my
45:38
uh my balance the price per token isn't changing but this means that i can now
45:44
um eliminate a huge portion of that rounding area rounding error that i'm
45:50
getting each step and it's not going to be causing such a big drift or a big inaccuracy anymore
45:57
hopefully that makes sense and in the full model i showed you a moment ago i've already got
46:03
that set up which is why i've got a really big number in my crypto pool and that transact that same
46:10
uh calculation done when i'm looking at the price and the value of my token
46:17
uh i'm just going to read some of these questions for a moment
46:24
chez you've got a interesting approach when we look at um doing both a purchase and a sale
46:31
transaction in the amm in the same step do you want to talk about that while i read some of the questions
46:38
yeah it's not really that i i'm going to talk about it in theory the idea here is that when
46:45
selling and purchasing happens in the same step let's say we are looking at uh
46:50
the total sold and bought across an entire day you can sum it up to
46:56
let's say 50 000 was bought and 100 000 was sold
47:02
that would amount to 50 000 was sold in the end right so what i'm doing is uh i'm basically making the difference
47:08
between the two and uh taking the result and using that in reality for one single
47:14
player um it will be important uh it's important whether the purchasing
47:21
happens first to like it's important that at what state the amm is at that particular moment for single player
47:26
because it will dictate the prices at the moment of the purchase but for the amm as a whole um and for the price of
47:34
the token going into the next day it becomes irrelevant for the the larger ecosystem so that's my approach for a
47:40
larger ecosystem i do not recommend it for a single player for a single player
47:46
probably it's best to handle individual transactions
47:52
perfect thank you very much a couple of uh great questions there's a very long
47:57
one i saw it i i don't know when you want to tackle it this is this is perfect because it's one
48:02
of those really important ones i want to talk about today so thank you alex for asking this question
48:08
um so the question is um is there a way to model different market behaviors of multiple amms for example if an in-game
48:17
token pair is available in two different amms how do you account for the different behavior from player personas
48:23
on different amms brilliant question so there's a few ways that we can kind of think about um that
48:30
type of approach of having you know if it's especially if it's a popular
48:36
token or if it's a popular game or whatever it is there are bound to be multiple amms
48:41
around impacting um and each one might have its own price it's going to have its own liquidity
48:47
pools everything else we could go down the route depending on what we're looking to simulate and what
48:53
we're looking to test inside machinations we could go down the route of creating multiples
48:58
and tracking each of these different um systems inside
49:05
machinations in reality what we tend to see is if there are
49:11
multiple amms and there's a big um or any kind of price disparity between
49:17
the two um through arbitrage there's gonna be people out there that will be looking
49:23
for these opportunities spotting those differences in the um
49:29
the values of the tokens and we'll be making trades between those multiple
49:34
amms um and effectively that balances out multiple amms
49:41
so quite often when we're thinking about this from a from a game economy perspective and we're looking to do some
49:47
testing to understand how the game economy operates and what that's going to potentially do to the token values
49:55
that um because of that arbitrage opportunity that gets created between multiple amms
50:01
and the fact that there'll be some trading that goes on that kind of balances them out it kind of it's a self-correcting system
50:08
where if there's if the added value of trying to build a
50:14
model with multiple amms and then building some logic so that if there is a disparity between them that
50:21
arbitrage takes place it's not necessarily going to give you any value to what you're actually trying
50:26
to model and actually trying to test therefore normally in the majority of
50:31
the models we're building when we're evaluating an economy we'll do just one amm and use that as a kind of indicator
50:39
of the um the kind of the token values i hope hopefully that makes sense great
50:45
question thanks for asking that um
50:51
my power whale coming in out might could you use the model to explain how a whale
50:57
coming in and out might impact the amm that's a great question um
51:02
so what i think really what the question is there and this is a whale kind of having
51:09
a huge impact on it could obviously make a difference the other one is
51:15
um you know a lot of teams that are certainly building games they'll go out
51:20
for external investment and those investors are often buying the token which is then going to be part of
51:27
the um part of their if the investment they'll
51:32
often have some kind of lock-in period or vesting period that they can't sell those tokens
51:38
until they vested so we'll quite often look at a game economy and look at what happens if the
51:45
person those investors that have those tokens double those tokens the moment they get released to them what impact
51:52
does that have so in the machinations model um
51:58
what we might be looking at is uh building a bit of extra logic in here to look at okay
52:05
here's the uh how many tokens are held so i'm gonna
52:11
say that there's fifty thousand fifty thousand uh resources here in this
52:19
pool and i'm going to create a little countdown
52:25
uh i'm not going to do the other way i'm going to create a countdown with the
52:30
drain so i'm going to say right
52:36
10 days in this is going to be set to push
52:43
and it's going to be automatic and it's gonna trigger when
52:49
this pool is less than one so once this pool is empty it's gonna
52:55
water it's gonna condition this pool it's gonna send these resources into my
53:01
token sold so now i'm going to make this so we're doing
53:07
both purchases and sales each day so now if we track our
53:14
token value at step 10 if i clear my chart for a moment
53:20
we can we've got our transactions going on of a couple of around about a thousand a day
53:27
or if i make that automatic it would help so now inside our logic here
53:35
uh at day 10 we're going to sell an extra 50 000 tokens and we can then hopefully we'll spot
53:41
this in our chart oh but i didn't write all on there
53:49
come on i'll try that again take two edit that
53:54
bit out uh we'll let that tick over get down to
53:59
uh 10 again we're going to put an extra 50 000 in our sold tokens
54:04
uh there they go very big transaction went through so we can check out our chart and see
54:11
what that did to our token values so that's a great way of kind of explaining or testing out how
54:18
those sorts of events could impact our our token values
54:25
hopefully that answers your question uh
54:31
excellent i think with blimey we're just about a time i think so this has been fantastic
54:39
uh i'd love to know if anybody has any other questions please do drop them in i'm going to hang around to answer this
54:44
last question we have could i give a quick overview of the basics of what operations represent from
54:51
the perspective of a user player investor selling tokens and liquidity by crypto etc
54:57
um so i'm going to use this model i think is a good example to kind of do that
55:03
first i'm going to take out those parts um
55:09
so i think the key kind of use case of the way in which i often think about these models and how
55:17
to actually use them in in anger if you like within any kind of
55:23
simulation that you're doing is often the key part that i'm looking
55:28
to simulate is what's going to happen with our token values and using an amm to understand
55:36
this relationship between um how much the tokens can be worth based against
55:42
its trading pair and here i've got a random number generator
55:47
which is saying how many tokens are being bought and sold each step
55:53
now here i've got this i'm just doing it with random numbers in
55:58
reality this is going to have some kind of logic around it which is going to represent the actions that are going on
56:04
inside the economy inside the game i often think of this as kind of being
56:11
this side of the amm is what's going on inside the game uh the right hand side
56:17
of this is what's going on outside of the world that's impacting our crypto values
56:22
now those crypto values aren't something that we're probably able to influence from
56:28
our game economy so once we've built out the logic that's looking at how players progress how
56:35
players interact how many tokens the players are receiving as potential rewards how many tokens players are
56:43
buying as um as kind of drains inside the economy or
56:48
something that they're that is beneficial to the player to give them a motivation to kind of using those
56:54
tokens what we then want to do is we want to look at the total number of tokens that are being bought and sold each step
57:02
and using that so rather than having a random number there's going to be some logic behind
57:08
how many tokens are being bought and sold and using that to drive our um amm model

to be able to understand well if we did have 10 000 players in the game and we had 20 of them that were
57:22
producing a certain number of tokens 80 of them which are consuming another amount of tokens what's that balance and
57:29
what's that going to do to our total supply and demand uh that's going to impact our amm
57:36
so hopefully that answers that question
57:41
uh and i must actually just give out um give a shout out
57:46

i'm not saying mine is the best but mine i think is is the one i understand the most which is why i

59:22
except for the fact that you told people you want to have more followers than me and i have a private account so i have zero followers so you're already winning
59:28
